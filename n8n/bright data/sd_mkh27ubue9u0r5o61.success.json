If you’re interested in being part of our team in the future, we encourage you to submit your application now. Working as part of an integrated investigations team you will support the overall mission of the ICRIR to provide information to families, victims and survivors of Troubles-related deaths and serious injury, and in doing so fulfil its principal objective of promoting reconciliation. As part of the Intelligence Unit, you will work under the supervision of the Intelligence Team leader and directly alongside analysts and researchers. You will have access to and become proficient in interrogating various Intelligence databases utilised by the ICRIR which you will use to complete a range of intelligence reports which will be delivered in different forms of communication. You will also work closely with Senior Investigating Officers and their teams to assist in identifying and locating suspects and subjects of interest. You will assist in identifying possible lines of enquiry by becoming a subject matter expert in legacy intelligence records and systems across a range of organisations involved in security provision in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. We welcome the unique contribution diverse applicants bring and do not discriminate based on culture, ethnicity, race, nationality or national origin, age, sex, gender identity or expression, religion or belief, disability status, sexual orientation, educational or social background or any other factor. We are happy to discuss the role and answer any questions you may have. Please feel free to contact us for an informal conversation by emailing us at recruitment@icrir.independent-inquiry.uk  Key Responsibilities    Support the implementation of intelligence procedures and policy for ICRIR in line with its strategy, objectives and directives.  Ensure compliance with legal and operational requirements and continuous service improvement and consistency of practice.  Proactively gather, develop and evaluate intelligence linked to cases being investigated by ICRIR to make an assessment of the risk, harm, vulnerabilities and opportunities which exist and to identify gaps.  Utilise existing data systems including sensitive national police systems and other open and closed intelligence sources to support the preparation and delivery of intelligence products and reports, such as subject profiles, to clearly and accurately inform decision making.  Support the production and delivery of coherent and structured reports and briefings to the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) and investigation teams on intelligence matters relating to investigations; including a series of weekly briefings.  Establish and maintain networks with internal partners to ensure their key requirements are met and with external agencies, including PSNI, MOD & Security Services, ensuring that relationships remain appropriate and professional.  Maintain awareness of innovation within intelligence to ensure implementation of latest techniques and tactics, best practice, and information relevant to the role. Be open in identifying new methods of research, tools and software to enhance the open-source capability.  Act as a subject matter expert for advice and guidance to ICRIR staff on all matters relation to closed/ sensitive material.  Establish and document audit trails for each piece of intelligence including quality assurance scrutiny to ensure validity and reliability.    Person Specification  Essential Criteria    Recent knowledge and experience of working within a sensitive and confidential intelligence environment.  Ability to deliver quality written reports, oral briefings and presentations at all levels.  Possess a track record of intelligence and information management with a comprehensive understanding of the National Intelligence Model.  Ability to ensure that all activities and research are compliant with RIPA, Computer Misuse Act, ECHR, CPIA and DPA legislation.  Ability to communicate with a range of stakeholders to provide information and intelligence and ensure understanding.  Strong relationship and partnership skills across external agencies and an ability to manage highly sensitive material.  Advanced Intelligence training including the Intelligence Professionalism Programme or equivalent relevant experience.  A high degree of self-motivation, personal responsibility and organisation.  Demonstrate the values set out in the ICRIR Code of Conduct.  Applicants for this role must be willing to undergo and attain DV clearance (if not already cleared) and attain and maintain STRAP accreditation. STRAP is a regime that regulates access to sensitive intelligence material which requires more protective handling than is afforded by the standard arrangements for government assets. For this Security Level, applicants are required to be a UK National. This is not an ICRIR requirement, but a condition required by the UK Cabinet Office rules based on the nature of information which the role holder will be regularly accessing. Please find further information on NSV  (National Security Vetting): National security vetting: clearance levels - GOV.UK   Desirable Criteria    Knowledge of Northern Ireland related terrorism.  Knowledge of intelligence computer operating systems, a confident IT user with good Excel, Word and intelligence systems including NSN, PSNI C3 Database, CT HOLMES, and open source tactics  About Us The Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery is an independent organisation that has been established to recover information about Troubles-related deaths and serious injuries to families, victims, and survivors and to promote reconciliation. We are building the Commission and hiring more staff now that we have begun receiving cases. We are building a values-led organisation. We operate with integrity, impartiality, openness, accountability, and respect, as set out in our Code of Conduct. This is reflected in our fair and open recruitment processes. We encourage people to join us across all backgrounds, communities and faiths to help us deliver. The Commission is primarily based in Belfast, with further operational sites in Northern Ireland and London. Travel to all locations will be required, but hybrid working arrangements will help us support a range of flexible working patterns. This is an exciting opportunity to join an organisation with a unique and vital remit. The Commission is formed of seven Commissioners, the Chief Commissioner, Sir Declan Morgan, the Chief Executive Officer, Louise Warde Hunter and the Commissioner for Investigations, Peter Sheridan, as well as four Non-Executive Commissioners to provide challenge and scrutiny to the executive team. We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive workplace. We welcome applications from all communities and backgrounds, including underrepresented groups. We value diversity in our workforce as it enhances our ability to serve the communities of Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.",

We are looking for civilian investigators to support the investigation of complex economic crime by gathering, analysing, and presenting evidence in line with legal requirements, ensuring victims and witnesses are supported, and helping to secure fair judicial outcomes. The focus of the role will be to contribute to case progression by undertaking investigative actions delegated by the Officer in Charge (OIC), enabling timely and proportionate resolution of investigations. Working for the Met doesn’t have to mean patrolling the streets. Just as important as our uniformed officers is our 14,000-strong team of professional and support staff working behind the scenes. It’s these skilled people who provide the organisational capability to police London.                Duties and Responsibilities:                               Take victim and witness statements to gather admissible evidence that strengthens case files.                Conduct suspect and intelligence interviews under the direction of the supervising officer to progress enquiries.                Secure, review, and analyse evidence (including CCTV, financial data, digital media, and third-party material) to inform case progression and trial preparation.                Prepare case files, disclosure schedules, and documentation for court, ensuring compliance with Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act (CPIA) obligations.                Carry out research across internal systems (e.g. CONNECT, IIP) and external databases to provide intelligence that shapes investigative strategy.                Apply for and execute warrants, production orders, and other legal processes to obtain evidence required for investigations.                Liaise with internal departments (e.g. Legal Services) and external partners (Crown Prosecution Service, financial institutions, other law enforcement agencies) to progress cases and ensure lawful information sharing.                Attend court to give evidence, ensuring accuracy and professional representation of the Metropolitan Police Service.                Engage with victims, witnesses, and suspects with professionalism and sensitivity, maintaining public confidence in policing.                Work collaboratively within the investigation team, contributing to joint decisions and supporting colleagues to achieve investigation objectives.                Manage a caseload of approximately 4-5 complex fraud investigations at any given time to ensure timely progression and resolution.                Maintain personal accreditation and training requirements to ensure competence in investigative practices.                Undertake evidence gathering and case preparation responsibilities consistent with the scope of a Detective Constable, while charging and prosecution decisions remain with supervising officers.                               Who we're looking for:                               Knowledge of the Fraud Act 2006, Bribery Act 2010, Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, Money Laundering Regulations, and Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE).                Understanding of case file preparation and disclosure requirements under CPIA.                Skilled in taking accurate witness statements and preparing clear records of evidence.                Able to conduct research and analysis using digital systems and case management tools (e.g. Altia Insight).                Competent in preparing and redacting sensitive documents in line with data protection and disclosure obligations.                Proficient in Microsoft Office applications (Outlook, Word, Excel) to prepare documents and reports.                Effective communication skills (verbal and written) to engage with a wide range of stakeholders including victims, witnesses, legal professionals, and colleagues.                Ability to prioritise tasks, manage workload to deadlines, and work both independently and as part of a team.                Experience of investigating crime to Professionalising Investigations Programme (PIP) Level 1 standard.                Experience of handling evidence, conducting suspect interviews, and managing custody or voluntary attendee procedures.

You’ll also enjoy the kind of great benefits that you’d expect from one of London's largest employers.

Location: Barking                               This is an exciting opportunity to join the Economic Crime/Complex Freud Team within Specialist Crime of the Metropolitan Police.               We are looking for civilian investigators to support the investigation of complex economic crime by gathering, analysing, and presenting evidence in line with legal requirements, ensuring victims and witnesses are supported, and helping to secure fair judicial outcomes. The focus of the role will be to contribute to case progression by undertaking investigative actions delegated by the Officer in Charge (OIC), enabling timely and proportionate resolution of investigations. Working for the Met doesn’t have to mean patrolling the streets. Just as important as our uniformed officers is our 14,000-strong team of professional and support staff working behind the scenes. It’s these skilled people who provide the organisational capability to police London.                Duties and Responsibilities:                               Take victim and witness statements to gather admissible evidence that strengthens case files.                Conduct suspect and intelligence interviews under the direction of the supervising officer to progress enquiries.                Secure, review, and analyse evidence (including CCTV, financial data, digital media, and third-party material) to inform case progression and trial preparation.                Prepare case files, disclosure schedules, and documentation for court, ensuring compliance with Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act (CPIA) obligations.                Carry out research across internal systems (e.g. CONNECT, IIP) and external databases to provide intelligence that shapes investigative strategy.                Apply for and execute warrants, production orders, and other legal processes to obtain evidence required for investigations.                Liaise with internal departments (e.g. Legal Services) and external partners (Crown Prosecution Service, financial institutions, other law enforcement agencies) to progress cases and ensure lawful information sharing.                Attend court to give evidence, ensuring accuracy and professional representation of the Metropolitan Police Service.                Engage with victims, witnesses, and suspects with professionalism and sensitivity, maintaining public confidence in policing.                Work collaboratively within the investigation team, contributing to joint decisions and supporting colleagues to achieve investigation objectives.                Manage a caseload of approximately 4-5 complex fraud investigations at any given time to ensure timely progression and resolution.                Maintain personal accreditation and training requirements to ensure competence in investigative practices.                Undertake evidence gathering and case preparation responsibilities consistent with the scope of a Detective Constable, while charging and prosecution decisions remain with supervising officers.

Understanding of case file preparation and disclosure requirements under CPIA.                Skilled in taking accurate witness statements and preparing clear records of evidence.                Able to conduct research and analysis using digital systems and case management tools (e.g. Altia Insight).                Competent in preparing and redacting sensitive documents in line with data protection and disclosure obligations.                Proficient in Microsoft Office applications (Outlook, Word, Excel) to prepare documents and reports.                Effective communication skills (verbal and written) to engage with a wide range of stakeholders including victims, witnesses, legal professionals, and colleagues.                Ability to prioritise tasks, manage workload to deadlines, and work both independently and as part of a team.                Experience of investigating crime to Professionalising Investigations Programme (PIP) Level 1 standard.

    "job_title": "Remote Evidence Facilitator Volunteer",
    "description_text": "The volunteer role is to support in Sussex to facilitate vulnerable victims & witnesses giving evidence in remote live link sites and/or Police video enabled justice rooms. This will include the setting up of the equipment and ‘meet & greet’ when the witness arrives at the live link location. This role is in conjunction with volunteers from Victim Support.   Roles are available, in West Sussex (Arun area) Brighton and Hove and Hastings area.   The Role & Key Responsibilities   You would be responsible for the practical management of the live link sites in Sussex on the day of the trial, to allow vulnerable victims and witnesses to give evidence away from a Court building. These sites will include both Video Enabled Justice (VEJ) rooms within police stations and Remote Live Link sites which are located East, West and Central. The Witness Care Officers within the Police Criminal Justice Unit (CJU) will be responsible for liaising with you to assess your availability and to provide you with details of the venue, timings and any other relevant information that may affect the way you interact with the victim or witnesses.   As the live link rooms are an extension of the Court, you would need to ensure the room is set up ready for use, comply with current government and force guidelines such as accommodating any social distancing requirements and carry out any necessary sanitation of equipment.   You will meet the victims/witnesses when they arrive and stay with them whilst they are on police premises, with the exception being whilst they are in the live link room giving evidence. In this instance, you would wait nearby.   You will work alongside volunteers from Victim Support (Citizens Advice Witness Service and Young Witness Service) who would offer the emotional support to Victims and Witnesses. Professional boundaries are important, so each volunteer is clear about their role and victims and witnesses feel supported and safe.   Once the victim/witness has given their evidence, you will be responsible for seeing them out of the building, switching off the equipment and carrying out any necessary sanitation of the room. You will call the Witness Care Officer to confirm that the victim/witness has finished giving their evidence and left.   You will at times be working with a minimal amount of intervention/supervision and will be accountable to the Criminal Justice Managers. You will be expected to make decisions and use your initiative.   Key responsibilities include;       To ensure the live link room is compliant with current force guidelines.    To ensure all equipment is set-up and ready for use in accordance with the guidance provided.    To act as a point of contact and meet with the witness on arrival at the agreed location. To remain with the witness whilst they are on police premises.    To print, provide and shred the witness statement for familiarisation of evidence.    To liaise with the Witness Care Officer from the Criminal Justice Unit once the victim/witness has left the location.

We are looking for civilian investigators to support the investigation of complex economic crime by gathering, analysing, and presenting evidence in line with legal requirements, ensuring victims and witnesses are supported, and helping to secure fair judicial outcomes. The focus of the role will be to contribute to case progression by undertaking investigative actions delegated by the Officer in Charge (OIC), enabling timely and proportionate resolution of investigations. Working for the Met doesn’t have to mean patrolling the streets. Just as important as our uniformed officers is our 14,000-strong team of professional and support staff working behind the scenes. It’s these skilled people who provide the organisational capability to police London.                Duties and Responsibilities:                               Take victim and witness statements to gather admissible evidence that strengthens case files.                Conduct suspect and intelligence interviews under the direction of the supervising officer to progress enquiries.                Secure, review, and analyse evidence (including CCTV, financial data, digital media, and third-party material) to inform case progression and trial preparation.                Prepare case files, disclosure schedules, and documentation for court, ensuring compliance with Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act (CPIA) obligations.                Carry out research across internal systems (e.g. CONNECT, IIP) and external databases to provide intelligence that shapes investigative strategy.                Apply for and execute warrants, production orders, and other legal processes to obtain evidence required for investigations.                Liaise with internal departments (e.g. Legal Services) and external partners (Crown Prosecution Service, financial institutions, other law enforcement agencies) to progress cases and ensure lawful information sharing.                Attend court to give evidence, ensuring accuracy and professional representation of the Metropolitan Police Service.                Engage with victims, witnesses, and suspects with professionalism and sensitivity, maintaining public confidence in policing.                Work collaboratively within the investigation team, contributing to joint decisions and supporting colleagues to achieve investigation objectives.                Manage a caseload of approximately 4-5 complex fraud investigations at any given time to ensure timely progression and resolution.                Maintain personal accreditation and training requirements to ensure competence in investigative practices.                Undertake evidence gathering and case preparation responsibilities consistent with the scope of a Detective Constable, while charging and prosecution decisions remain with supervising officers.                               Who we're looking for:                               Knowledge of the Fraud Act 2006, Bribery Act 2010, Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, Money Laundering Regulations, and Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE).                Understanding of case file preparation and disclosure requirements under CPIA.                Skilled in taking accurate witness statements and preparing clear records of evidence.                Able to conduct research and analysis using digital systems and case management tools (e.g. Altia Insight).                Competent in preparing and redacting sensitive documents in line with data protection and disclosure obligations.                Proficient in Microsoft Office applications (Outlook, Word, Excel) to prepare documents and reports.                Effective communication skills (verbal and written) to engage with a wide range of stakeholders including victims, witnesses, legal professionals, and colleagues.                Ability to prioritise tasks, manage workload to deadlines, and work both independently and as part of a team.                Experience of investigating crime to Professionalising Investigations Programme (PIP) Level 1 standard.                Experience of handling evidence, conducting suspect interviews, and managing custody or voluntary attendee procedures.

You’ll also enjoy the kind of great benefits that you’d expect from one of London's largest employers.

Location: Barking                               This is an exciting opportunity to join the Economic Crime/Complex Freud Team within Specialist Crime of the Metropolitan Police.               We are looking for civilian investigators to support the investigation of complex economic crime by gathering, analysing, and presenting evidence in line with legal requirements, ensuring victims and witnesses are supported, and helping to secure fair judicial outcomes. The focus of the role will be to contribute to case progression by undertaking investigative actions delegated by the Officer in Charge (OIC), enabling timely and proportionate resolution of investigations. Working for the Met doesn’t have to mean patrolling the streets. Just as important as our uniformed officers is our 14,000-strong team of professional and support staff working behind the scenes. It’s these skilled people who provide the organisational capability to police London.                Duties and Responsibilities:                               Take victim and witness statements to gather admissible evidence that strengthens case files.                Conduct suspect and intelligence interviews under the direction of the supervising officer to progress enquiries.                Secure, review, and analyse evidence (including CCTV, financial data, digital media, and third-party material) to inform case progression and trial preparation.                Prepare case files, disclosure schedules, and documentation for court, ensuring compliance with Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act (CPIA) obligations.                Carry out research across internal systems (e.g. CONNECT, IIP) and external databases to provide intelligence that shapes investigative strategy.                Apply for and execute warrants, production orders, and other legal processes to obtain evidence required for investigations.                Liaise with internal departments (e.g. Legal Services) and external partners (Crown Prosecution Service, financial institutions, other law enforcement agencies) to progress cases and ensure lawful information sharing.                Attend court to give evidence, ensuring accuracy and professional representation of the Metropolitan Police Service.                Engage with victims, witnesses, and suspects with professionalism and sensitivity, maintaining public confidence in policing.                Work collaboratively within the investigation team, contributing to joint decisions and supporting colleagues to achieve investigation objectives.                Manage a caseload of approximately 4-5 complex fraud investigations at any given time to ensure timely progression and resolution.                Maintain personal accreditation and training requirements to ensure competence in investigative practices.                Undertake evidence gathering and case preparation responsibilities consistent with the scope of a Detective Constable, while charging and prosecution decisions remain with supervising officers.

Understanding of case file preparation and disclosure requirements under CPIA.                Skilled in taking accurate witness statements and preparing clear records of evidence.                Able to conduct research and analysis using digital systems and case management tools (e.g. Altia Insight).                Competent in preparing and redacting sensitive documents in line with data protection and disclosure obligations.                Proficient in Microsoft Office applications (Outlook, Word, Excel) to prepare documents and reports.                Effective communication skills (verbal and written) to engage with a wide range of stakeholders including victims, witnesses, legal professionals, and colleagues.                Ability to prioritise tasks, manage workload to deadlines, and work both independently and as part of a team.                Experience of investigating crime to Professionalising Investigations Programme (PIP) Level 1 standard.

Stage 2  Test - After submission of the first stage of your application you will be invited to complete a Caseworker Skills Test. If you successfully pass the test, you will be invited to complete the final stage of the application.     Please complete the online tests as soon as possible (within 24-48 hours is recommended), the closing date for a fully completed application is 23:55 on 27/01/2026. If you fail to complete the online test before the deadline your application will be withdrawn. Guidance will be available when you are invited to take the test. The tests are administered online and accessed via the Civil Service Jobs website.      **IMPORTANT: After the test deadline, we will look at all applicant scores to decide what the jobs pass mark will be. We will consider the impact on protected groups and the number of invitations to the next stage. We may decide to raise the pass mark for the job - if so, you will be informed, and you will be told if you have passed or failed at the raised standard. Meeting the minimum test requirements for a job level is no guarantee of an invite to continue the selection process.     Depending on the volume of applications, we may choose to progress all candidates who meet the required score at the test stage, straight to interview without conducting a sift. For this reason, the timeline post-test is subject to change depending on the approach we take.      Stage 3 - Written Application and Sift - As part of the application process, you will be asked to complete a personal statement in no more than 750 words, detailing the relevant skills and experience you can bring to the role, based on the key criteria listed. Please pay particular attention to the lead criteria and second lead criteria as if you do not demonstrate these on your application, you will not progress to the interview stage.           Explain how you have conducted a robust and challenging interview or conversation either via telephone or face to face and achieved an outcome (Lead question).       Describe when you analysed a range of information sources to make a difficult decision.      Can you detail when you have had to prioritise your workload in line with conflicting and changing priorities?          You will also be asked to complete a CV with details of your education, professional qualifications and full employment history. Your CV will not be formally assessed so please put the main evidence of your skills into your personal statement. Your CV will be used to add context to your personal statement. Should a large number of applications be received, an initial sift may be conducted using the lead question. Candidates who pass the initial sift may be progressed to a full sift or progressed straight to an interview. The sift is scheduled to be held from 02/02/2025 to 20/02/2026.      Stage 4 - Interview - If you pass the written application sift with the required score you will be invited to a blended interview and will receive an electronic notification to your Civil Service Jobs account.     Interviews will be conducted face to face and where possible, at the location listed in the Candidate Pack (slide 2). However, Candidates may be expected to travel to alternative locations as required.     If you require any reasonable adjustments to attend a face-to-face interview, please ensure you state those on your application form when asked to do so. Interviews are scheduled to take place from week commencing 30/03/2026 - 17/04/2026. Please note that these dates are only indicative at this stage and could be subject to change. Interviews will be scheduled Monday to Friday, between 09:00 to 17:00.     Communications will be electronic and/or by SMS/telephone therefore it is important that you check your Civil Service Jobs account regularly, as well as your spam/junk email folder. Telephone calls may show as a withheld number, it is important that you answer so that your interview can be confirmed. If you wish to opt out of SMS messages, please email this address, including the vacancy reference and your candidate ID CFCD.RECRUITMENTINBOX@DWP.GOV.UK. As part of our commitment to improving the candidate experience, you may be contacted during the recruitment process to provide feedback.      Preparing for the Interview The interview will take approximately between 30 - 40 minutes and will consist of a presentation plus experience, technical, behaviour and strength-based questions. You will be provided with a pack prior to your interview detailing the requirements of the presentation.      A blended interview aims to be more of a conversation offering a more inclusive approach. The behaviour and strength-based questioning explores what you, the candidate, can and have done, but also your potential.      Behaviours     You will be assessed against the Civil Service Behaviours listed at level 2.     An example of a behavioural question would be Tell me about a time when you have had to deal with a difficult customer. / How did you lead by example to inspire and motivate your teams?.     It may help to use one or more examples of a piece of work you have completed or a situation you have been in and use the WHO or STAR model above to explain:           WHO - What it was? How you approached the work/situation? What the Outcomes were, what did you achieve? or       STAR - What was the Situation? What were the Tasks? What Action did you take? What were the Results of your actions?           Strengths     It is difficult to prepare for strength type questions. However, you can think through your answers, focus on your achievements and aspects you enjoy and decide how these can be applied in the organisation and role. While strengths questions are shorter and we do not expect a full STAR response, the panel is interested in your first reaction to the question and information or reasoning to support this.     If you do not have work-based examples then please give examples from school/college, clubs, volunteering or other activities you have been involved in.     If high application volumes are received, the benchmark for candidates to proceed at any stage of the process may be raised. In line with our commitment to the Disability Confident Scheme (DCS), we aim to advance all DCS candidates who meet the minimum standard. However, we may only progress those candidates who best meet the required standards.      If you withdraw your application at any stage, it will not be progressed any further.      Stage 5 - Offer - Once all interviews have been completed, you'll be notified of the outcome by email. Offers will be made in strict merit order to the highest scoring candidate first.     The successful candidates will be notified of a start date following successful pre employment and security checks, which is likely to be during June/July 2026.      **Please note that these dates are indicative and may be subject to change.**     A reserve list may be held for a period of 3 months from which further appointments can be made.

Reasonable Adjustments     We consider visible and non-visible disabilities, neurodiversity or learning differences, chronic medical conditions, or mental ill health. Examples include dyslexia, epilepsy, autism, chronic fatigue, or schizophrenia.     If you need a change to be made so that you can make your application, you should contact the Government Recruitment Service via DWPRecruitment.grs@cabinetoffice.gov.uk as soon as possible before the closing date to discuss your needs.

For instance, you may need wheelchair access at interview, or if youre deaf, a Language Service Professional.     If you are experiencing accessibility problems with any attachments on this advert, please contact the email address in the 'Contact point for applicants' section.      Integrity, plagiarism and Civil Service Principles     The Civil Service values honesty and integrity and expects all candidates to abide by these principles.     Please ensure that all examples provided in your application are taken directly from your own experience and that you describe the examples in your own words.     Examples of plagiarism can include:           Presenting the work, ideas and experience of others as your own      Copying content or answers from an online or published source that is not your own           Disclosure and Barring Service and Internal Fraud Database Checks     In order to process applications without delay, we will be sending a Criminal Record Check to Disclosure and Barring Service/Disclosure Scotland on your behalf.     However, we recognise in exceptional circumstances some candidates will want to send their completed forms direct. If you will be doing this, please advise Government Recruitment Service of your intention by emailing Pre-EmploymentChecks.grs@cabinetoffice.gov.uk stating the job reference number in the subject heading.     Applicants who are successful at interview will be, as part of pre-employment screening, subject to a check on the Internal Fraud Database (IFD). This check will provide information about employees who have been dismissed for fraud or dishonesty offences. This check also applies to employees who resign or otherwise leave before being dismissed for fraud or dishonesty had their employment continued. Any applicants details held on the IFD will be refused employment. A candidate is not eligible to apply for a role within the Civil Service if the application is made within a 5 year period following a dismissal for carrying out internal fraud against government.     If successful and transferring from another Government Department, a criminal record check will be carried out.      Important     New entrants are expected to join on the minimum of the pay band.     Before applying for this vacancy, current employees of DWP should check whether a successful application would result in changes to their terms & conditions of employment, e.g. mobility, pay, allowances. If you are a current employee and are successful you must be able to be released from your current post within four weeks.     Those on protected TUPE/ COSoP terms and conditions applying on promotion or voluntary permanent level move will adopt DWPs Terms and Conditions and this may have a different impact on pay and allowances. Please review this prior to acceptance of a role.  Civil Servants that would transfer into DWP from other government organisations, following successful application, will assume DWP's terms & conditions of employment current on the day they are posted, unless DWP has stated otherwise in writing. Accepting a post will be taken to mean acceptance of revised terms & conditions.     Civil Servants applying on promotion will usually be appointed to the salary minimum or within 10% of existing salary.     Any move to DWP from another employer will mean you can no longer access childcare vouchers. This includes moves between government departments. You may, however, be eligible for other government schemes, including Tax Free Childcare. Determine your eligibility at the Childcare Choices Website.     DWP takes development seriously.

Stage 2  Test - After submission of the first stage of your application you will be invited to complete a Caseworker Skills Test. If you successfully pass the test, you will be invited to complete the final stage of the application.     Please complete the online tests as soon as possible (within 24-48 hours is recommended), the closing date for a fully completed application is 23:55 on 27/01/2026. If you fail to complete the online test before the deadline your application will be withdrawn. Guidance will be available when you are invited to take the test. The tests are administered online and accessed via the Civil Service Jobs website.      **IMPORTANT: After the test deadline, we will look at all applicant scores to decide what the jobs pass mark will be. We will consider the impact on protected groups and the number of invitations to the next stage. We may decide to raise the pass mark for the job - if so, you will be informed, and you will be told if you have passed or failed at the raised standard. Meeting the minimum test requirements for a job level is no guarantee of an invite to continue the selection process.     Depending on the volume of applications, we may choose to progress all candidates who meet the required score at the test stage, straight to interview without conducting a sift. For this reason, the timeline post-test is subject to change depending on the approach we take.      Stage 3 - Written Application and Sift - As part of the application process, you will be asked to complete a personal statement in no more than 750 words, detailing the relevant skills and experience you can bring to the role, based on the key criteria listed. Please pay particular attention to the lead criteria and second lead criteria as if you do not demonstrate these on your application, you will not progress to the interview stage.           Explain how you have conducted a robust and challenging interview or conversation either via telephone or face to face and achieved an outcome (Lead question).       Describe when you analysed a range of information sources to make a difficult decision.      Can you detail when you have had to prioritise your workload in line with conflicting and changing priorities?          You will also be asked to complete a CV with details of your education, professional qualifications and full employment history. Your CV will not be formally assessed so please put the main evidence of your skills into your personal statement. Your CV will be used to add context to your personal statement. Should a large number of applications be received, an initial sift may be conducted using the lead question. Candidates who pass the initial sift may be progressed to a full sift or progressed straight to an interview. The sift is scheduled to be held from 02/02/2025 to 20/02/2026.      Stage 4 - Interview - If you pass the written application sift with the required score you will be invited to a blended interview and will receive an electronic notification to your Civil Service Jobs account.     Interviews will be conducted face to face and where possible, at the location listed in the Candidate Pack (slide 2). However, Candidates may be expected to travel to alternative locations as required.     If you require any reasonable adjustments to attend a face-to-face interview, please ensure you state those on your application form when asked to do so. Interviews are scheduled to take place from week commencing 30/03/2026 - 17/04/2026. Please note that these dates are only indicative at this stage and could be subject to change. Interviews will be scheduled Monday to Friday, between 09:00 to 17:00.     Communications will be electronic and/or by SMS/telephone therefore it is important that you check your Civil Service Jobs account regularly, as well as your spam/junk email folder. Telephone calls may show as a withheld number, it is important that you answer so that your interview can be confirmed. If you wish to opt out of SMS messages, please email this address, including the vacancy reference and your candidate ID CFCD.RECRUITMENTINBOX@DWP.GOV.UK. As part of our commitment to improving the candidate experience, you may be contacted during the recruitment process to provide feedback.      Preparing for the Interview The interview will take approximately between 30 - 40 minutes and will consist of a presentation plus experience, technical, behaviour and strength-based questions. You will be provided with a pack prior to your interview detailing the requirements of the presentation.      A blended interview aims to be more of a conversation offering a more inclusive approach. The behaviour and strength-based questioning explores what you, the candidate, can and have done, but also your potential.      Behaviours     You will be assessed against the Civil Service Behaviours listed at level 2.     An example of a behavioural question would be Tell me about a time when you have had to deal with a difficult customer. / How did you lead by example to inspire and motivate your teams?.     It may help to use one or more examples of a piece of work you have completed or a situation you have been in and use the WHO or STAR model above to explain:           WHO - What it was? How you approached the work/situation? What the Outcomes were, what did you achieve? or       STAR - What was the Situation? What were the Tasks? What Action did you take? What were the Results of your actions?           Strengths     It is difficult to prepare for strength type questions. However, you can think through your answers, focus on your achievements and aspects you enjoy and decide how these can be applied in the organisation and role. While strengths questions are shorter and we do not expect a full STAR response, the panel is interested in your first reaction to the question and information or reasoning to support this.     If you do not have work-based examples then please give examples from school/college, clubs, volunteering or other activities you have been involved in.     If high application volumes are received, the benchmark for candidates to proceed at any stage of the process may be raised. In line with our commitment to the Disability Confident Scheme (DCS), we aim to advance all DCS candidates who meet the minimum standard. However, we may only progress those candidates who best meet the required standards.      If you withdraw your application at any stage, it will not be progressed any further.      Stage 5 - Offer - Once all interviews have been completed, you'll be notified of the outcome by email. Offers will be made in strict merit order to the highest scoring candidate first.     The successful candidates will be notified of a start date following successful pre employment and security checks, which is likely to be during June/July 2026.      **Please note that these dates are indicative and may be subject to change.**     A reserve list may be held for a period of 3 months from which further appointments can be made.     Please note the following:           Please note that these vacancies are not currently eligible for new applications for Visa Sponsorship on the Skilled Worker route, for any candidates who do not currently have permission to be in the UK as a Skilled Worker where they were sponsored before 4 April 2024, even if relying on tradeable points (including the new entrant tradeable points option) as they do not satisfy the minimum salary hourly rate requirement.

Integrity, plagiarism and Civil Service Principles     The Civil Service values honesty and integrity and expects all candidates to abide by these principles.     Please ensure that all examples provided in your application are taken directly from your own experience and that you describe the examples in your own words.     Examples of plagiarism can include:           Presenting the work, ideas and experience of others as your own      Copying content or answers from an online or published source that is not your own           Disclosure and Barring Service and Internal Fraud Database Checks     In order to process applications without delay, we will be sending a Criminal Record Check to Disclosure and Barring Service/Disclosure Scotland on your behalf.     However, we recognise in exceptional circumstances some candidates will want to send their completed forms direct. If you will be doing this, please advise Government Recruitment Service of your intention by emailing Pre-EmploymentChecks.grs@cabinetoffice.gov.uk stating the job reference number in the subject heading.     Applicants who are successful at interview will be, as part of pre-employment screening, subject to a check on the Internal Fraud Database (IFD). This check will provide information about employees who have been dismissed for fraud or dishonesty offences. This check also applies to employees who resign or otherwise leave before being dismissed for fraud or dishonesty had their employment continued. Any applicants details held on the IFD will be refused employment. A candidate is not eligible to apply for a role within the Civil Service if the application is made within a 5 year period following a dismissal for carrying out internal fraud against government.     If successful and transferring from another Government Department, a criminal record check will be carried out.      Important     New entrants are expected to join on the minimum of the pay band.     Before applying for this vacancy, current employees of DWP should check whether a successful application would result in changes to their terms & conditions of employment, e.g. mobility, pay, allowances. If you are a current employee and are successful you must be able to be released from your current post within four weeks.     Those on protected TUPE/ COSoP terms and conditions applying on promotion or voluntary permanent level move will adopt DWPs Terms and Conditions and this may have a different impact on pay and allowances. Please review this prior to acceptance of a role.  Civil Servants that would transfer into DWP from other government organisations, following successful application, will assume DWP's terms & conditions of employment current on the day they are posted, unless DWP has stated otherwise in writing. Accepting a post will be taken to mean acceptance of revised terms & conditions.     Civil Servants applying on promotion will usually be appointed to the salary minimum or within 10% of existing salary.     Any move to DWP from another employer will mean you can no longer access childcare vouchers. This includes moves between government departments. You may, however, be eligible for other government schemes, including Tax Free Childcare. Determine your eligibility at the Childcare Choices Website.     DWP takes development seriously. Our aim is for our colleagues in these roles to be appropriately skilled and qualified  as determined by the business. To support this aim you may be required to undertake a work based qualification, which may be in the form of an apprenticeship, which will support you in further developing your professional knowledge and skills for this role and your future career development.

A candidate is not eligible to apply for a role within the Civil Service if the application is made within a 5 year period following a dismissal for carrying out internal fraud against government.</p>\n     <p>If successful and transferring from another Government Department, a criminal record check will be carried out.</p>\n     <p><b> Important</b></p>\n     <p>New entrants are expected to join on the minimum of the pay band.</p>\n     <p>Before applying for this vacancy, current employees of DWP should check whether a successful application would result in changes to their terms &amp; conditions of employment, e.g. mobility, pay, allowances. If you are a current employee and are successful you must be able to be released from your current post within four weeks.</p>\n     <p>Those on protected TUPE/ COSoP terms and conditions applying on promotion or voluntary permanent level move will adopt DWP&#x92;s Terms and Conditions and this may have a different impact on pay and allowances. Please review this prior to acceptance of a role.<br> <br> Civil Servants that would transfer into DWP from other government organisations, following successful application, will assume DWP&apos;s terms &amp; conditions of employment current on the day they are posted, unless DWP has stated otherwise in writing. Accepting a post will be taken to mean acceptance of revised terms &amp; conditions.</p>\n     <p>Civil Servants applying on promotion will usually be appointed to the salary minimum or within 10% of existing salary.</p>\n     <p>Any move to DWP from another employer will mean you can no longer access childcare vouchers. This includes moves between government departments. You may, however, be eligible for other government schemes, including Tax Free Childcare. Determine your eligibility at the Childcare Choices Website.</p>\n     <p>DWP takes development seriously.

Come and train as a Council Warden and then use your skills to improve management of parking and civil enforcement issues across the District.

This could include working with schools to resolve problem parking and improve road safety and days of action with the Police as part of a multi-agency approach to resolve a number of issues in an area where parking enforcement is required. You will be dealing with parking issues including tackling inconsiderate and dangerous parking. Following formal training and shadowing on patrol, you’ll be expected to issue notices for parking contraventions, littering and dog fouling.       As a result of your work you will resolve parking problems in the area.    You’ll need to be happy patrolling district-wide in all weathers.    Applicants will need the literacy skills to issue PCNs for civil offences and to complete relevant documents, however no formal qualifications are required.

The salary is broken down as £35,998 basic salary, which will increase annually until you reach the top of the scale £38,523. Plus, a location allowance of £1,928 and a non-pensionable allowance of £1,000.                Location: Barking                               This is an exciting opportunity to join the Economic Crime/Complex Freud Team within Specialist Crime of the Metropolitan Police.               We are looking for civilian investigators to support the investigation of complex economic crime by gathering, analysing, and presenting evidence in line with legal requirements, ensuring victims and witnesses are supported, and helping to secure fair judicial outcomes. The focus of the role will be to contribute to case progression by undertaking investigative actions delegated by the Officer in Charge (OIC), enabling timely and proportionate resolution of investigations. Working for the Met doesn’t have to mean patrolling the streets. Just as important as our uniformed officers is our 14,000-strong team of professional and support staff working behind the scenes. It’s these skilled people who provide the organisational capability to police London.                Duties and Responsibilities:                               Take victim and witness statements to gather admissible evidence that strengthens case files.                Conduct suspect and intelligence interviews under the direction of the supervising officer to progress enquiries.                Secure, review, and analyse evidence (including CCTV, financial data, digital media, and third-party material) to inform case progression and trial preparation.                Prepare case files, disclosure schedules, and documentation for court, ensuring compliance with Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act (CPIA) obligations.                Carry out research across internal systems (e.g. CONNECT, IIP) and external databases to provide intelligence that shapes investigative strategy.                Apply for and execute warrants, production orders, and other legal processes to obtain evidence required for investigations.                Liaise with internal departments (e.g. Legal Services) and external partners (Crown Prosecution Service, financial institutions, other law enforcement agencies) to progress cases and ensure lawful information sharing.                Attend court to give evidence, ensuring accuracy and professional representation of the Metropolitan Police Service.                Engage with victims, witnesses, and suspects with professionalism and sensitivity, maintaining public confidence in policing.                Work collaboratively within the investigation team, contributing to joint decisions and supporting colleagues to achieve investigation objectives.                Manage a caseload of approximately 4-5 complex fraud investigations at any given time to ensure timely progression and resolution.                Maintain personal accreditation and training requirements to ensure competence in investigative practices.                Undertake evidence gathering and case preparation responsibilities consistent with the scope of a Detective Constable, while charging and prosecution decisions remain with supervising officers.                               Who we're looking for:                               Knowledge of the Fraud Act 2006, Bribery Act 2010, Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, Money Laundering Regulations, and Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE).                Understanding of case file preparation and disclosure requirements under CPIA.                Skilled in taking accurate witness statements and preparing clear records of evidence.                Able to conduct research and analysis using digital systems and case management tools (e.g. Altia Insight).                Competent in preparing and redacting sensitive documents in line with data protection and disclosure obligations.                Proficient in Microsoft Office applications (Outlook, Word, Excel) to prepare documents and reports.                Effective communication skills (verbal and written) to engage with a wide range of stakeholders including victims, witnesses, legal professionals, and colleagues.                Ability to prioritise tasks, manage workload to deadlines, and work both independently and as part of a team.

We are looking for civilian investigators to support the investigation of complex economic crime by gathering, analysing, and presenting evidence in line with legal requirements, ensuring victims and witnesses are supported, and helping to secure fair judicial outcomes. The focus of the role will be to contribute to case progression by undertaking investigative actions delegated by the Officer in Charge (OIC), enabling timely and proportionate resolution of investigations. Working for the Met doesn’t have to mean patrolling the streets. Just as important as our uniformed officers is our 14,000-strong team of professional and support staff working behind the scenes. It’s these skilled people who provide the organisational capability to police London.                Duties and Responsibilities:                               Take victim and witness statements to gather admissible evidence that strengthens case files.                Conduct suspect and intelligence interviews under the direction of the supervising officer to progress enquiries.                Secure, review, and analyse evidence (including CCTV, financial data, digital media, and third-party material) to inform case progression and trial preparation.                Prepare case files, disclosure schedules, and documentation for court, ensuring compliance with Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act (CPIA) obligations.                Carry out research across internal systems (e.g. CONNECT, IIP) and external databases to provide intelligence that shapes investigative strategy.                Apply for and execute warrants, production orders, and other legal processes to obtain evidence required for investigations.                Liaise with internal departments (e.g. Legal Services) and external partners (Crown Prosecution Service, financial institutions, other law enforcement agencies) to progress cases and ensure lawful information sharing.                Attend court to give evidence, ensuring accuracy and professional representation of the Metropolitan Police Service.                Engage with victims, witnesses, and suspects with professionalism and sensitivity, maintaining public confidence in policing.                Work collaboratively within the investigation team, contributing to joint decisions and supporting colleagues to achieve investigation objectives.                Manage a caseload of approximately 4-5 complex fraud investigations at any given time to ensure timely progression and resolution.                Maintain personal accreditation and training requirements to ensure competence in investigative practices.                Undertake evidence gathering and case preparation responsibilities consistent with the scope of a Detective Constable, while charging and prosecution decisions remain with supervising officers.

Understanding of case file preparation and disclosure requirements under CPIA.                Skilled in taking accurate witness statements and preparing clear records of evidence.                Able to conduct research and analysis using digital systems and case management tools (e.g. Altia Insight).                Competent in preparing and redacting sensitive documents in line with data protection and disclosure obligations.                Proficient in Microsoft Office applications (Outlook, Word, Excel) to prepare documents and reports.                Effective communication skills (verbal and written) to engage with a wide range of stakeholders including victims, witnesses, legal professionals, and colleagues.

Os byddwch yn llwyddiannus, ein nod yw cynnig un o'ch dewisiadau yn y lle cyntaf. Er y gwneir pob ymdrech i ddarparu ar gyfer eich dewisiadau o ran lleoliad, mae Gwasanaeth Erlyn y Goron yn sefydliad cenedlaethol sydd â gwahaniaethau o ran adfer gweithrediadau, lefelau swyddi gwag a llwyth achosion ledled y wlad - sy'n golygu y gallech gael cynnig rôl mewn ardal Gwasanaeth Erlyn y Goron arall sydd y tu allan i'r ardal rydych yn ei ffafrio.  Os cewch eich gwahodd i gyfweliad, cewch eich asesu a'ch cyfweld gan banel priodol a gwneir cynigion yn nhrefn teilyngdod.  Sylwch mai'r ymddygiad arweiniol yn ystod y cyfweliad yw gwneud penderfyniadau effeithiol.

Os ydych yn gwneud cais am y swydd hon ac yn byw yn yr Alban neu yng Ngogledd Iwerddon, rhaid i chi roi gwybod i ni wrth dderbyn y cynnig hwn gan fod angen caniatâd arnoch i weithio o'ch cyfeiriad cartref os yw gweithio hybrid yn rhan o'ch rôl.

Bydd y rhestr wrth gefn yn cael ei dileu 6 mis ar ôl cynnal y cyfweliadau ac ni ellir gwarantu swyddi ar gyfer eich dewis cyntaf.

Os byddwch yn llwyddiannus, ein nod yw cynnig un o'ch dewisiadau yn y lle cyntaf.
