We are looking for civilian investigators to support the investigation of complex economic crime by gathering, analysing, and presenting evidence in line with legal requirements, ensuring victims and witnesses are supported, and helping to secure fair judicial outcomes. The focus of the role will be to contribute to case progression by undertaking investigative actions delegated by the Officer in Charge (OIC), enabling timely and proportionate resolution of investigations.

Conduct suspect and intelligence interviews under the direction of the supervising officer to progress enquiries.

Prepare case files, disclosure schedules, and documentation for court, ensuring compliance with Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act (CPIA) obligations.                Carry out research across internal systems (e.g. CONNECT, IIP) and external databases to provide intelligence that shapes investigative strategy.                Apply for and execute warrants, production orders, and other legal processes to obtain evidence required for investigations.                Liaise with internal departments (e.g. Legal Services) and external partners (Crown Prosecution Service, financial institutions, other law enforcement agencies) to progress cases and ensure lawful information sharing.                Attend court to give evidence, ensuring accuracy and professional representation of the Metropolitan Police Service.                Engage with victims, witnesses, and suspects with professionalism and sensitivity, maintaining public confidence in policing.                Work collaboratively within the investigation team, contributing to joint decisions and supporting colleagues to achieve investigation objectives.                Manage a caseload of approximately 4-5 complex fraud investigations at any given time to ensure timely progression and resolution.                Maintain personal accreditation and training requirements to ensure competence in investigative practices.                Undertake evidence gathering and case preparation responsibilities consistent with the scope of a Detective Constable, while charging and prosecution decisions remain with supervising officers.

Competent in preparing and redacting sensitive documents in line with data protection and disclosure obligations.                Proficient in Microsoft Office applications (Outlook, Word, Excel) to prepare documents and reports.                Effective communication skills (verbal and written) to engage with a wide range of stakeholders including victims, witnesses, legal professionals, and colleagues.

Location: Barking                               This is an exciting opportunity to join the Economic Crime/Complex Freud Team within Specialist Crime of the Metropolitan Police.               We are looking for civilian investigators to support the investigation of complex economic crime by gathering, analysing, and presenting evidence in line with legal requirements, ensuring victims and witnesses are supported, and helping to secure fair judicial outcomes. The focus of the role will be to contribute to case progression by undertaking investigative actions delegated by the Officer in Charge (OIC), enabling timely and proportionate resolution of investigations. Working for the Met doesn’t have to mean patrolling the streets. Just as important as our uniformed officers is our 14,000-strong team of professional and support staff working behind the scenes. It’s these skilled people who provide the organisational capability to police London.                Duties and Responsibilities:                               Take victim and witness statements to gather admissible evidence that strengthens case files.                Conduct suspect and intelligence interviews under the direction of the supervising officer to progress enquiries.                Secure, review, and analyse evidence (including CCTV, financial data, digital media, and third-party material) to inform case progression and trial preparation.                Prepare case files, disclosure schedules, and documentation for court, ensuring compliance with Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act (CPIA) obligations.                Carry out research across internal systems (e.g. CONNECT, IIP) and external databases to provide intelligence that shapes investigative strategy.                Apply for and execute warrants, production orders, and other legal processes to obtain evidence required for investigations.                Liaise with internal departments (e.g. Legal Services) and external partners (Crown Prosecution Service, financial institutions, other law enforcement agencies) to progress cases and ensure lawful information sharing.                Attend court to give evidence, ensuring accuracy and professional representation of the Metropolitan Police Service.                Engage with victims, witnesses, and suspects with professionalism and sensitivity, maintaining public confidence in policing.                Work collaboratively within the investigation team, contributing to joint decisions and supporting colleagues to achieve investigation objectives.                Manage a caseload of approximately 4-5 complex fraud investigations at any given time to ensure timely progression and resolution.                Maintain personal accreditation and training requirements to ensure competence in investigative practices.                Undertake evidence gathering and case preparation responsibilities consistent with the scope of a Detective Constable, while charging and prosecution decisions remain with supervising officers.

Understanding of case file preparation and disclosure requirements under CPIA.                Skilled in taking accurate witness statements and preparing clear records of evidence.                Able to conduct research and analysis using digital systems and case management tools (e.g. Altia Insight).                Competent in preparing and redacting sensitive documents in line with data protection and disclosure obligations.                Proficient in Microsoft Office applications (Outlook, Word, Excel) to prepare documents and reports.                Effective communication skills (verbal and written) to engage with a wide range of stakeholders including victims, witnesses, legal professionals, and colleagues.                Ability to prioritise tasks, manage workload to deadlines, and work both independently and as part of a team.                Experience of investigating crime to Professionalising Investigations Programme (PIP) Level 1 standard.

Location: Barking                               This is an exciting opportunity to join the Economic Crime/Complex Freud Team within Specialist Crime of the Metropolitan Police.               We are looking for civilian investigators to support the investigation of complex economic crime by gathering, analysing, and presenting evidence in line with legal requirements, ensuring victims and witnesses are supported, and helping to secure fair judicial outcomes. The focus of the role will be to contribute to case progression by undertaking investigative actions delegated by the Officer in Charge (OIC), enabling timely and proportionate resolution of investigations. Working for the Met doesn’t have to mean patrolling the streets. Just as important as our uniformed officers is our 14,000-strong team of professional and support staff working behind the scenes. It’s these skilled people who provide the organisational capability to police London.                Duties and Responsibilities:                               Take victim and witness statements to gather admissible evidence that strengthens case files.                Conduct suspect and intelligence interviews under the direction of the supervising officer to progress enquiries.                Secure, review, and analyse evidence (including CCTV, financial data, digital media, and third-party material) to inform case progression and trial preparation.                Prepare case files, disclosure schedules, and documentation for court, ensuring compliance with Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act (CPIA) obligations.                Carry out research across internal systems (e.g. CONNECT, IIP) and external databases to provide intelligence that shapes investigative strategy.                Apply for and execute warrants, production orders, and other legal processes to obtain evidence required for investigations.                Liaise with internal departments (e.g. Legal Services) and external partners (Crown Prosecution Service, financial institutions, other law enforcement agencies) to progress cases and ensure lawful information sharing.                Attend court to give evidence, ensuring accuracy and professional representation of the Metropolitan Police Service.                Engage with victims, witnesses, and suspects with professionalism and sensitivity, maintaining public confidence in policing.                Work collaboratively within the investigation team, contributing to joint decisions and supporting colleagues to achieve investigation objectives.                Manage a caseload of approximately 4-5 complex fraud investigations at any given time to ensure timely progression and resolution.                Maintain personal accreditation and training requirements to ensure competence in investigative practices.                Undertake evidence gathering and case preparation responsibilities consistent with the scope of a Detective Constable, while charging and prosecution decisions remain with supervising officers.                               Who we're looking for:                               Knowledge of the Fraud Act 2006, Bribery Act 2010, Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, Money Laundering Regulations, and Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE).                Understanding of case file preparation and disclosure requirements under CPIA.                Skilled in taking accurate witness statements and preparing clear records of evidence.                Able to conduct research and analysis using digital systems and case management tools (e.g. Altia Insight).                Competent in preparing and redacting sensitive documents in line with data protection and disclosure obligations.                Proficient in Microsoft Office applications (Outlook, Word, Excel) to prepare documents and reports.                Effective communication skills (verbal and written) to engage with a wide range of stakeholders including victims, witnesses, legal professionals, and colleagues.                Ability to prioritise tasks, manage workload to deadlines, and work both independently and as part of a team.                Experience of investigating crime to Professionalising Investigations Programme (PIP) Level 1 standard.                Experience of handling evidence, conducting suspect interviews, and managing custody or voluntary attendee procedures.

You’ll also enjoy the kind of great benefits that you’d expect from one of London's largest employers.

Location: Barking                               This is an exciting opportunity to join the Economic Crime/Complex Freud Team within Specialist Crime of the Metropolitan Police.               We are looking for civilian investigators to support the investigation of complex economic crime by gathering, analysing, and presenting evidence in line with legal requirements, ensuring victims and witnesses are supported, and helping to secure fair judicial outcomes. The focus of the role will be to contribute to case progression by undertaking investigative actions delegated by the Officer in Charge (OIC), enabling timely and proportionate resolution of investigations. Working for the Met doesn’t have to mean patrolling the streets. Just as important as our uniformed officers is our 14,000-strong team of professional and support staff working behind the scenes. It’s these skilled people who provide the organisational capability to police London.                Duties and Responsibilities:                               Take victim and witness statements to gather admissible evidence that strengthens case files.                Conduct suspect and intelligence interviews under the direction of the supervising officer to progress enquiries.                Secure, review, and analyse evidence (including CCTV, financial data, digital media, and third-party material) to inform case progression and trial preparation.                Prepare case files, disclosure schedules, and documentation for court, ensuring compliance with Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act (CPIA) obligations.                Carry out research across internal systems (e.g. CONNECT, IIP) and external databases to provide intelligence that shapes investigative strategy.                Apply for and execute warrants, production orders, and other legal processes to obtain evidence required for investigations.                Liaise with internal departments (e.g. Legal Services) and external partners (Crown Prosecution Service, financial institutions, other law enforcement agencies) to progress cases and ensure lawful information sharing.                Attend court to give evidence, ensuring accuracy and professional representation of the Metropolitan Police Service.                Engage with victims, witnesses, and suspects with professionalism and sensitivity, maintaining public confidence in policing.                Work collaboratively within the investigation team, contributing to joint decisions and supporting colleagues to achieve investigation objectives.                Manage a caseload of approximately 4-5 complex fraud investigations at any given time to ensure timely progression and resolution.                Maintain personal accreditation and training requirements to ensure competence in investigative practices.                Undertake evidence gathering and case preparation responsibilities consistent with the scope of a Detective Constable, while charging and prosecution decisions remain with supervising officers.

Understanding of case file preparation and disclosure requirements under CPIA.                Skilled in taking accurate witness statements and preparing clear records of evidence.                Able to conduct research and analysis using digital systems and case management tools (e.g. Altia Insight).                Competent in preparing and redacting sensitive documents in line with data protection and disclosure obligations.                Proficient in Microsoft Office applications (Outlook, Word, Excel) to prepare documents and reports.                Effective communication skills (verbal and written) to engage with a wide range of stakeholders including victims, witnesses, legal professionals, and colleagues.                Ability to prioritise tasks, manage workload to deadlines, and work both independently and as part of a team.                Experience of investigating crime to Professionalising Investigations Programme (PIP) Level 1 standard.

If you fail to complete the online test before the deadline your application will be withdrawn. Guidance will be available when you are invited to take the test. The tests are administered online and accessed via the Civil Service Jobs website.      **IMPORTANT: After the test deadline, we will look at all applicant scores to decide what the jobs pass mark will be. We will consider the impact on protected groups and the number of invitations to the next stage. We may decide to raise the pass mark for the job - if so, you will be informed, and you will be told if you have passed or failed at the raised standard. Meeting the minimum test requirements for a job level is no guarantee of an invite to continue the selection process.     Depending on the volume of applications, we may choose to progress all candidates who meet the required score at the test stage, straight to interview without conducting a sift. For this reason, the timeline post-test is subject to change depending on the approach we take.      Stage 3 - Written Application and Sift - As part of the application process, you will be asked to complete a personal statement in no more than 750 words, detailing the relevant skills and experience you can bring to the role, based on the key criteria listed. Please pay particular attention to the lead criteria and second lead criteria as if you do not demonstrate these on your application, you will not progress to the interview stage.           Explain how you have conducted a robust and challenging interview or conversation either via telephone or face to face and achieved an outcome (Lead question).       Describe when you analysed a range of information sources to make a difficult decision.      Can you detail when you have had to prioritise your workload in line with conflicting and changing priorities?          You will also be asked to complete a CV with details of your education, professional qualifications and full employment history. Your CV will not be formally assessed so please put the main evidence of your skills into your personal statement. Your CV will be used to add context to your personal statement. Should a large number of applications be received, an initial sift may be conducted using the lead question. Candidates who pass the initial sift may be progressed to a full sift or progressed straight to an interview. The sift is scheduled to be held from 02/02/2025 to 20/02/2026.      Stage 4 - Interview - If you pass the written application sift with the required score you will be invited to a blended interview and will receive an electronic notification to your Civil Service Jobs account.     Interviews will be conducted face to face and where possible, at the location listed in the Candidate Pack (slide 2). However, Candidates may be expected to travel to alternative locations as required.     If you require any reasonable adjustments to attend a face-to-face interview, please ensure you state those on your application form when asked to do so. Interviews are scheduled to take place from week commencing 30/03/2026 - 17/04/2026. Please note that these dates are only indicative at this stage and could be subject to change. Interviews will be scheduled Monday to Friday, between 09:00 to 17:00.     Communications will be electronic and/or by SMS/telephone therefore it is important that you check your Civil Service Jobs account regularly, as well as your spam/junk email folder. Telephone calls may show as a withheld number, it is important that you answer so that your interview can be confirmed. If you wish to opt out of SMS messages, please email this address, including the vacancy reference and your candidate ID CFCD.RECRUITMENTINBOX@DWP.GOV.UK. As part of our commitment to improving the candidate experience, you may be contacted during the recruitment process to provide feedback.      Preparing for the Interview The interview will take approximately between 30 - 40 minutes and will consist of a presentation plus experience, technical, behaviour and strength-based questions. You will be provided with a pack prior to your interview detailing the requirements of the presentation.      A blended interview aims to be more of a conversation offering a more inclusive approach. The behaviour and strength-based questioning explores what you, the candidate, can and have done, but also your potential.      Behaviours     You will be assessed against the Civil Service Behaviours listed at level 2.     An example of a behavioural question would be Tell me about a time when you have had to deal with a difficult customer. / How did you lead by example to inspire and motivate your teams?.     It may help to use one or more examples of a piece of work you have completed or a situation you have been in and use the WHO or STAR model above to explain:           WHO - What it was? How you approached the work/situation? What the Outcomes were, what did you achieve? or       STAR - What was the Situation? What were the Tasks? What Action did you take? What were the Results of your actions?           Strengths     It is difficult to prepare for strength type questions. However, you can think through your answers, focus on your achievements and aspects you enjoy and decide how these can be applied in the organisation and role. While strengths questions are shorter and we do not expect a full STAR response, the panel is interested in your first reaction to the question and information or reasoning to support this.     If you do not have work-based examples then please give examples from school/college, clubs, volunteering or other activities you have been involved in.     If high application volumes are received, the benchmark for candidates to proceed at any stage of the process may be raised. In line with our commitment to the Disability Confident Scheme (DCS), we aim to advance all DCS candidates who meet the minimum standard. However, we may only progress those candidates who best meet the required standards.      If you withdraw your application at any stage, it will not be progressed any further.      Stage 5 - Offer - Once all interviews have been completed, you'll be notified of the outcome by email. Offers will be made in strict merit order to the highest scoring candidate first.     The successful candidates will be notified of a start date following successful pre employment and security checks, which is likely to be during June/July 2026.      **Please note that these dates are indicative and may be subject to change.**     A reserve list may be held for a period of 3 months from which further appointments can be made.

This is a voluntary, non-contractual arrangement and your office will be your contractual place of work. The number of days that anyone will be able to work at home will be determined primarily by business need, but personal circumstances and other relevant circumstances will also be taken into account.

Integrity, plagiarism and Civil Service Principles     The Civil Service values honesty and integrity and expects all candidates to abide by these principles.     Please ensure that all examples provided in your application are taken directly from your own experience and that you describe the examples in your own words.     Examples of plagiarism can include:           Presenting the work, ideas and experience of others as your own      Copying content or answers from an online or published source that is not your own           Disclosure and Barring Service and Internal Fraud Database Checks     In order to process applications without delay, we will be sending a Criminal Record Check to Disclosure and Barring Service/Disclosure Scotland on your behalf.     However, we recognise in exceptional circumstances some candidates will want to send their completed forms direct. If you will be doing this, please advise Government Recruitment Service of your intention by emailing Pre-EmploymentChecks.grs@cabinetoffice.gov.uk stating the job reference number in the subject heading.     Applicants who are successful at interview will be, as part of pre-employment screening, subject to a check on the Internal Fraud Database (IFD). This check will provide information about employees who have been dismissed for fraud or dishonesty offences. This check also applies to employees who resign or otherwise leave before being dismissed for fraud or dishonesty had their employment continued. Any applicants details held on the IFD will be refused employment. A candidate is not eligible to apply for a role within the Civil Service if the application is made within a 5 year period following a dismissal for carrying out internal fraud against government.     If successful and transferring from another Government Department, a criminal record check will be carried out.      Important     New entrants are expected to join on the minimum of the pay band.     Before applying for this vacancy, current employees of DWP should check whether a successful application would result in changes to their terms & conditions of employment, e.g. mobility, pay, allowances. If you are a current employee and are successful you must be able to be released from your current post within four weeks.     Those on protected TUPE/ COSoP terms and conditions applying on promotion or voluntary permanent level move will adopt DWPs Terms and Conditions and this may have a different impact on pay and allowances. Please review this prior to acceptance of a role.  Civil Servants that would transfer into DWP from other government organisations, following successful application, will assume DWP's terms & conditions of employment current on the day they are posted, unless DWP has stated otherwise in writing. Accepting a post will be taken to mean acceptance of revised terms & conditions.     Civil Servants applying on promotion will usually be appointed to the salary minimum or within 10% of existing salary.     Any move to DWP from another employer will mean you can no longer access childcare vouchers. This includes moves between government departments. You may, however, be eligible for other government schemes, including Tax Free Childcare. Determine your eligibility at the Childcare Choices Website.     DWP takes development seriously.

Stage 3 - Written Application and Sift - As part of the application process, you will be asked to complete a personal statement in no more than 750 words, detailing the relevant skills and experience you can bring to the role, based on the key criteria listed. Please pay particular attention to the lead criteria and second lead criteria as if you do not demonstrate these on your application, you will not progress to the interview stage.           Explain how you have conducted a robust and challenging interview or conversation either via telephone or face to face and achieved an outcome (Lead question).       Describe when you analysed a range of information sources to make a difficult decision.      Can you detail when you have had to prioritise your workload in line with conflicting and changing priorities?          You will also be asked to complete a CV with details of your education, professional qualifications and full employment history. Your CV will not be formally assessed so please put the main evidence of your skills into your personal statement. Your CV will be used to add context to your personal statement. Should a large number of applications be received, an initial sift may be conducted using the lead question. Candidates who pass the initial sift may be progressed to a full sift or progressed straight to an interview. The sift is scheduled to be held from 02/02/2025 to 20/02/2026.      Stage 4 - Interview - If you pass the written application sift with the required score you will be invited to a blended interview and will receive an electronic notification to your Civil Service Jobs account.     Interviews will be conducted face to face and where possible, at the location listed in the Candidate Pack (slide 2). However, Candidates may be expected to travel to alternative locations as required.     If you require any reasonable adjustments to attend a face-to-face interview, please ensure you state those on your application form when asked to do so. Interviews are scheduled to take place from week commencing 30/03/2026 - 17/04/2026. Please note that these dates are only indicative at this stage and could be subject to change. Interviews will be scheduled Monday to Friday, between 09:00 to 17:00.     Communications will be electronic and/or by SMS/telephone therefore it is important that you check your Civil Service Jobs account regularly, as well as your spam/junk email folder. Telephone calls may show as a withheld number, it is important that you answer so that your interview can be confirmed. If you wish to opt out of SMS messages, please email this address, including the vacancy reference and your candidate ID CFCD.RECRUITMENTINBOX@DWP.GOV.UK. As part of our commitment to improving the candidate experience, you may be contacted during the recruitment process to provide feedback.      Preparing for the Interview The interview will take approximately between 30 - 40 minutes and will consist of a presentation plus experience, technical, behaviour and strength-based questions. You will be provided with a pack prior to your interview detailing the requirements of the presentation.      A blended interview aims to be more of a conversation offering a more inclusive approach. The behaviour and strength-based questioning explores what you, the candidate, can and have done, but also your potential.      Behaviours     You will be assessed against the Civil Service Behaviours listed at level 2.     An example of a behavioural question would be Tell me about a time when you have had to deal with a difficult customer. / How did you lead by example to inspire and motivate your teams?.     It may help to use one or more examples of a piece of work you have completed or a situation you have been in and use the WHO or STAR model above to explain:           WHO - What it was? How you approached the work/situation? What the Outcomes were, what did you achieve? or       STAR - What was the Situation? What were the Tasks? What Action did you take? What were the Results of your actions?           Strengths     It is difficult to prepare for strength type questions. However, you can think through your answers, focus on your achievements and aspects you enjoy and decide how these can be applied in the organisation and role. While strengths questions are shorter and we do not expect a full STAR response, the panel is interested in your first reaction to the question and information or reasoning to support this.     If you do not have work-based examples then please give examples from school/college, clubs, volunteering or other activities you have been involved in.     If high application volumes are received, the benchmark for candidates to proceed at any stage of the process may be raised. In line with our commitment to the Disability Confident Scheme (DCS), we aim to advance all DCS candidates who meet the minimum standard. However, we may only progress those candidates who best meet the required standards.      If you withdraw your application at any stage, it will not be progressed any further.      Stage 5 - Offer - Once all interviews have been completed, you'll be notified of the outcome by email. Offers will be made in strict merit order to the highest scoring candidate first.     The successful candidates will be notified of a start date following successful pre employment and security checks, which is likely to be during June/July 2026.      **Please note that these dates are indicative and may be subject to change.**     A reserve list may be held for a period of 3 months from which further appointments can be made.     Please note the following:           Please note that these vacancies are not currently eligible for new applications for Visa Sponsorship on the Skilled Worker route, for any candidates who do not currently have permission to be in the UK as a Skilled Worker where they were sponsored before 4 April 2024, even if relying on tradeable points (including the new entrant tradeable points option) as they do not satisfy the minimum salary hourly rate requirement. This information is offered as guidance only, and we recommend that applicants seek specialist advice on their eligibility for Visa Sponsorship (if applicable) when considering whether to apply for any role.      Where high application volumes are received, the benchmark for candidates to proceed at any stage may be raised. In line with our commitment to the Disability Confident Scheme (DCS), we aim to advance all DCS candidates who meet the minimum standard. However, we may only progress those candidates who best meet the required standards.      Communications will be by email/phone/text, so please check your Civil Service Jobs account and junk/spam folder regularly.      Feedback will only be provided if you attend an interview or assessment.      If you withdraw your application at any stage, it will not be progressed any further.          Integrity Matters  Ensure Your Application Reflects You     The Civil Service values honesty and integrity and expects all candidates to abide by these principles. Please ensure that all examples provided in your application are taken directly from your own experience and that you describe the examples in your own words. Applications will be screened and if evidence of plagiarism or copying examples/answers from other sources is found, your application will be withdrawn. Internal DWP candidates may also face disciplinary action.     The evidence you provide must relate to your own experiences. If evidence of plagiarism, or sharing of questions, information or answers throughout any part of the selection process is found, your application will be withdrawn. Examples of plagiarism can include:           Presenting the work, ideas and experience of others as your own.      Copying content from an online/published source.      Using forms of Artificial Intelligence to produce application content which you present as your own.           Important information      Location      Check slide 2 in the candidate pack for the list of available locations. Apply only for roles where daily travel to your home office would be practical. This role is UK-based and cannot be worked overseas.      Relocation costs are not covered. Make sure the location works for you before applying!      Hybrid working     This job role may be suitable for hybrid working, which is where an employee works part of the week in their DWP office and part of the week from home. This is a voluntary, non-contractual arrangement and your office will be your contractual place of work. The number of days that anyone will be able to work at home will be determined primarily by business need, but personal circumstances and other relevant circumstances will also be taken into account. If you are successful, any opportunities for hybrid working, including whether a hybrid working arrangement is suitable for you, will be discussed with you prior to you taking up your post.     Hybrid working will not commence until any training and consolidation period has been successfully completed.      Working pattern      We strive to balance flexibility with operational requirements to support our teams effectively.           We consider part-time, part-year, term-time, compressed hours, and job-sharing arrangements, but must meet business needs.      Existing part-time contractsWe aim to honour existing part-time contracts, though working days and daily hours may change.      Full-time training commitment alternative working patterns begin after completing required training and consolidation. This ensures you gain the knowledge and skills needed to excel in your role before transitioning to your agreed working pattern.           Further Information      At the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) we value diversity and inclusion and actively encourage and welcome applications from everyone, including those that are underrepresented in our workforce.     Find out more about working for DWP on the DWP Careers Hub.      Disability Confident Scheme     If high application volumes are received, the benchmark for candidates to proceed to the next stage may be raised. In line with our commitment to the Disability Confident Scheme (DCS), we aim to advance all candidates applying under the DCS who meet the minimum standard. However, we may only progress those candidates who best meet the required standards.      Reasonable Adjustments     We consider visible and non-visible disabilities, neurodiversity or learning differences, chronic medical conditions, or mental ill health. Examples include dyslexia, epilepsy, autism, chronic fatigue, or schizophrenia.     If you need a change to be made so that you can make your application, you should contact the Government Recruitment Service via DWPRecruitment.grs@cabinetoffice.gov.uk as soon as possible before the closing date to discuss your needs.

For instance, you may need wheelchair access at interview, or if youre deaf, a Language Service Professional.     If you are experiencing accessibility problems with any attachments on this advert, please contact the email address in the 'Contact point for applicants' section.      Integrity, plagiarism and Civil Service Principles     The Civil Service values honesty and integrity and expects all candidates to abide by these principles.     Please ensure that all examples provided in your application are taken directly from your own experience and that you describe the examples in your own words.     Examples of plagiarism can include:           Presenting the work, ideas and experience of others as your own      Copying content or answers from an online or published source that is not your own           Disclosure and Barring Service and Internal Fraud Database Checks     In order to process applications without delay, we will be sending a Criminal Record Check to Disclosure and Barring Service/Disclosure Scotland on your behalf.     However, we recognise in exceptional circumstances some candidates will want to send their completed forms direct. If you will be doing this, please advise Government Recruitment Service of your intention by emailing Pre-EmploymentChecks.grs@cabinetoffice.gov.uk stating the job reference number in the subject heading.     Applicants who are successful at interview will be, as part of pre-employment screening, subject to a check on the Internal Fraud Database (IFD). This check will provide information about employees who have been dismissed for fraud or dishonesty offences. This check also applies to employees who resign or otherwise leave before being dismissed for fraud or dishonesty had their employment continued. Any applicants details held on the IFD will be refused employment. A candidate is not eligible to apply for a role within the Civil Service if the application is made within a 5 year period following a dismissal for carrying out internal fraud against government.     If successful and transferring from another Government Department, a criminal record check will be carried out.      Important     New entrants are expected to join on the minimum of the pay band.     Before applying for this vacancy, current employees of DWP should check whether a successful application would result in changes to their terms & conditions of employment, e.g. mobility, pay, allowances. If you are a current employee and are successful you must be able to be released from your current post within four weeks.     Those on protected TUPE/ COSoP terms and conditions applying on promotion or voluntary permanent level move will adopt DWPs Terms and Conditions and this may have a different impact on pay and allowances. Please review this prior to acceptance of a role.  Civil Servants that would transfer into DWP from other government organisations, following successful application, will assume DWP's terms & conditions of employment current on the day they are posted, unless DWP has stated otherwise in writing. Accepting a post will be taken to mean acceptance of revised terms & conditions.     Civil Servants applying on promotion will usually be appointed to the salary minimum or within 10% of existing salary.     Any move to DWP from another employer will mean you can no longer access childcare vouchers. This includes moves between government departments. You may, however, be eligible for other government schemes, including Tax Free Childcare. Determine your eligibility at the Childcare Choices Website.     DWP takes development seriously. Our aim is for our colleagues in these roles to be appropriately skilled and qualified  as determined by the business. To support this aim you may be required to undertake a work based qualification, which may be in the form of an apprenticeship, which will support you in further developing your professional knowledge and skills for this role and your future career development. The qualification can be undertaken in work time, you agree to take this job on the basis that you may be required to undertake a work based qualification; a candidates failure to participate fully in the professional programme, once appointed, may be a breach of their employment contract.      Important     If you hold a level 3 qualification (2 A levels or equivalent) then please bring your certificates with you to the interview if you have them.

Please pay particular attention to the lead criteria and second lead criteria as if you do not demonstrate these on your application, you will not progress to the interview stage.</p>\n     <ul>\n      <li>Explain how you have conducted a robust and challenging interview or conversation either via telephone or face to face and achieved an outcome <b>(Lead question). </b></li>\n      <li>Describe when you analysed a range of information sources to make a difficult decision.</li>\n      <li>Can you detail when you have had to prioritise your workload in line with conflicting and changing priorities?</li>\n     </ul>\n     <p>You will also be asked to complete a CV with details of your education, professional qualifications and full employment history.<b> </b>Your CV will not be formally assessed so please put the main evidence of your skills into your personal statement. Your CV will be used to add context to your personal statement. Should a large number of applications be received, an initial sift may be conducted using the lead question. Candidates who pass the initial sift may be progressed to a full sift or progressed straight to an interview. The sift is scheduled to be held from <b>02/02/2025 to 20/02/2026.</b></p>\n     <p><b> Stage 4 - Interview -</b> If you pass the written application sift with the required score you will be invited to a blended interview and will receive an electronic notification to your Civil Service Jobs account.</p>\n     <p>Interviews will be conducted face to face and where possible, at the location listed in the Candidate Pack (slide 2). <b>However,</b> <b>Candidates may be expected to travel to alternative locations as required</b>.</p>\n     <p>If you require any reasonable adjustments to attend a face-to-face interview, please ensure you state those on your application form when asked to do so. Interviews are scheduled to take place from week commencing <b>30</b><b>/03/2026 - 17/04/2026.</b> Please note that these dates are only indicative at this stage and could be subject to change. Interviews will be scheduled Monday to Friday, between 09:00 to 17:00.</p>\n     <p>Communications will be electronic and/or by SMS/telephone therefore it is important that you check your Civil Service Jobs account regularly, as well as your spam/junk email folder. Telephone calls may show as a withheld number, it is important that you answer so that your interview can be confirmed. If you wish to opt out of SMS messages, please email this address, including the vacancy reference and your candidate ID CFCD.RECRUITMENTINBOX@DWP.GOV.UK. As part of our commitment to improving the candidate experience, you may be contacted during the recruitment process to provide feedback.</p>\n     <p><b> Preparing for the Interview</b><br> The interview will take approximately between 30 - 40 minutes and will consist of a presentation plus experience, technical, behaviour and strength-based questions. You will be provided with a pack prior to your interview detailing the requirements of the presentation.</p>\n     <p><br> A blended interview aims to be more of a conversation offering a more inclusive approach. The behaviour and strength-based questioning explores what you, the candidate, can and have done, but also your potential.</p>\n     <p><b> Behaviours</b></p>\n     <p>You will be assessed against the Civil Service Behaviours listed at level 2.</p>\n     <p>An example of a behavioural question would be &#x93;Tell me about a time when you have had to deal with a difficult customer.&#x94; / &#x93;How did you lead by example to inspire and motivate your teams?&#x94;.</p>\n     <p>It may help to use one or more examples of a piece of work you have completed or a situation you have been in and use the <b>WHO</b> or <b>STAR</b> model above to explain:</p>\n     <ul>\n      <li><b>WHO</b> - <b>W</b>hat it was? <b>H</b>ow you approached the work/situation? What the <b>O</b>utcomes were, what did you achieve? <i>or</i></li>\n      <li><b> STAR</b> - What was the <b>S</b>ituation? What were the <b>T</b>asks? What <b>A</b>ction did you take? What were the <b>R</b>esults of your actions?</li>\n     </ul>\n     <p><b> Strengths</b></p>\n     <p>It is difficult to prepare for strength type questions. However, you can think through your answers, focus on your achievements and aspects you enjoy and decide how these can be applied in the organisation and role. While strengths questions are shorter and we do not expect a full STAR response, the panel is interested in your first reaction to the question and information or reasoning to support this.</p>\n     <p>If you do not have work-based examples then please give examples from school/college, clubs, volunteering or other activities you have been involved in.</p>\n     <p>If high application volumes are received, the benchmark for candidates to proceed at any stage of the process may be raised. In line with our commitment to the Disability Confident Scheme (DCS), we aim to advance all DCS candidates who meet the minimum standard. However, we may only progress those candidates who best meet the required standards.<br> <br></p>\n     <p><b>If you withdraw your application at any stage, it will not be progressed any further.</b></p>\n     <p><b> Stage 5 - Offer</b> - Once all interviews have been completed, you&apos;ll be notified of the outcome by email. Offers will be made in strict merit order to the highest scoring candidate first.</p>\n     <p>The successful candidates will be notified of a start date following successful pre employment and security checks, which is likely to be during <b>June/July 2026</b>.</p>\n     <p><b> **Please note that these dates are indicative and may be subject to change.**</b></p>\n     <p>A reserve list may be held for a period of 3 months from which further appointments can be made.</p>\n     <p>Please note the following:</p>\n     <ul>\n      <li>Please note that these vacancies are not currently eligible for new applications for Visa Sponsorship on the Skilled Worker route, for any candidates who do not currently have permission to be in the UK as a Skilled Worker where they were sponsored before 4 April 2024, even if relying on tradeable points (including the new entrant tradeable points option) as they do not satisfy the minimum salary hourly rate requirement. This information is offered as guidance only, and we recommend that applicants seek specialist advice on their eligibility for Visa Sponsorship (if applicable) when considering whether to apply for any role.</li>\n      <li>Where high application volumes are received, the benchmark for candidates to proceed at any stage may be raised.

Please ensure that all examples provided in your application are taken directly from your own experience and that you describe the examples in your own words. Applications will be screened and if evidence of plagiarism or copying examples/answers from other sources is found, your application will be withdrawn. Internal DWP candidates may also face disciplinary action.</p>\n     <p>The evidence you provide must relate to your own experiences. If evidence of plagiarism, or sharing of questions, information or answers throughout any part of the selection process is found, your application will be withdrawn. Examples of plagiarism can include:</p>\n     <ul>\n      <li>Presenting the work, ideas and experience of others as your own.</li>\n      <li>Copying content from an online/published source.</li>\n      <li>Using forms of Artificial Intelligence to produce application content which you present as your own.</li>\n     </ul>\n     <p><b> Important information </b></p>\n     <p><b>Location</b></p>\n     <p><b> Check slide 2 in the candidate pack</b> for the list of available locations.

This is a voluntary, non-contractual arrangement and your office will be your contractual place of work. The number of days that anyone will be able to work at home will be determined primarily by business need, but personal circumstances and other relevant circumstances will also be taken into account. If you are successful, any opportunities for hybrid working, including whether a hybrid working arrangement is suitable for you, will be discussed with you prior to you taking up your post.</p>\n     <p><b>Hybrid working will not commence until any training and consolidation period has been successfully completed. </b></p>\n     <p><b>Working pattern </b></p>\n     <p>We strive to balance flexibility with operational requirements to support our teams effectively.</p>\n     <ul>\n      <li>We consider part-time, part-year, term-time, compressed hours, and job-sharing arrangements, but must meet business needs.</li>\n      <li><b>Existing part-time contracts</b>&#x96;We aim to honour existing part-time contracts, though working days and daily hours may change.</li>\n      <li><b>Full-time training commitment</b>&#x96; alternative working patterns begin after completing required training and consolidation.

Examples include dyslexia, epilepsy, autism, chronic fatigue, or schizophrenia.</p>\n     <p>If you need a change to be made so that you can make your application, you should contact the Government Recruitment Service via DWPRecruitment.grs@cabinetoffice.gov.uk as soon as possible before the closing date to discuss your needs.</p>\n     <p>Complete the &#x93;Reasonable Adjustments&#x94; section in the &#x93;Additional requirements&#x94; page of your application form to tell us what changes or help you might need further on in the recruitment process.

If you will be doing this, please advise Government Recruitment Service of your intention by emailing Pre-EmploymentChecks.grs@cabinetoffice.gov.uk stating the job reference number in the subject heading.</p>\n     <p>Applicants who are successful at interview will be, as part of pre-employment screening, subject to a check on the Internal Fraud Database (IFD). This check will provide information about employees who have been dismissed for fraud or dishonesty offences. This check also applies to employees who resign or otherwise leave before being dismissed for fraud or dishonesty had their employment continued. Any applicant&#x92;s details held on the IFD will be refused employment. A candidate is not eligible to apply for a role within the Civil Service if the application is made within a 5 year period following a dismissal for carrying out internal fraud against government.</p>\n     <p>If successful and transferring from another Government Department, a criminal record check will be carried out.</p>\n     <p><b> Important</b></p>\n     <p>New entrants are expected to join on the minimum of the pay band.</p>\n     <p>Before applying for this vacancy, current employees of DWP should check whether a successful application would result in changes to their terms &amp; conditions of employment, e.g. mobility, pay, allowances. If you are a current employee and are successful you must be able to be released from your current post within four weeks.</p>\n     <p>Those on protected TUPE/ COSoP terms and conditions applying on promotion or voluntary permanent level move will adopt DWP&#x92;s Terms and Conditions and this may have a different impact on pay and allowances. Please review this prior to acceptance of a role.<br> <br> Civil Servants that would transfer into DWP from other government organisations, following successful application, will assume DWP&apos;s terms &amp; conditions of employment current on the day they are posted, unless DWP has stated otherwise in writing. Accepting a post will be taken to mean acceptance of revised terms &amp; conditions.</p>\n     <p>Civil Servants applying on promotion will usually be appointed to the salary minimum or within 10% of existing salary.</p>\n     <p>Any move to DWP from another employer will mean you can no longer access childcare vouchers. This includes moves between government departments. You may, however, be eligible for other government schemes, including Tax Free Childcare.

Examples of when this may apply include:              Transferring to another force              Renewing vetting clearance              Moving into a role requiring MV clearance (even if you currently hold MV clearance)              Moving into or working in a role involving close contact with vulnerable individuals                          If any of the above apply to you, please expect your line manager to be contacted when you submit your vetting application.                            Redeployment and Redundancy This vacancy is open to employees at risk of redundancy and will remain available to redeployees until a final offer has been agreed and accepted. Redeployees at risk of redundancy will take priority over all other applicants at any stage of the recruitment process. If successful, redeployees will remain on their home force’s terms and conditions.
