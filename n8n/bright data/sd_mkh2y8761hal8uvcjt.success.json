We are looking for civilian investigators to support the investigation of complex economic crime by gathering, analysing, and presenting evidence in line with legal requirements, ensuring victims and witnesses are supported, and helping to secure fair judicial outcomes. The focus of the role will be to contribute to case progression by undertaking investigative actions delegated by the Officer in Charge (OIC), enabling timely and proportionate resolution of investigations.

It’s these skilled people who provide the organisational capability to police London.                Duties and Responsibilities:                               Take victim and witness statements to gather admissible evidence that strengthens case files.                Conduct suspect and intelligence interviews under the direction of the supervising officer to progress enquiries.

Prepare case files, disclosure schedules, and documentation for court, ensuring compliance with Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act (CPIA) obligations.                Carry out research across internal systems (e.g. CONNECT, IIP) and external databases to provide intelligence that shapes investigative strategy.                Apply for and execute warrants, production orders, and other legal processes to obtain evidence required for investigations.                Liaise with internal departments (e.g. Legal Services) and external partners (Crown Prosecution Service, financial institutions, other law enforcement agencies) to progress cases and ensure lawful information sharing.                Attend court to give evidence, ensuring accuracy and professional representation of the Metropolitan Police Service.                Engage with victims, witnesses, and suspects with professionalism and sensitivity, maintaining public confidence in policing.                Work collaboratively within the investigation team, contributing to joint decisions and supporting colleagues to achieve investigation objectives.                Manage a caseload of approximately 4-5 complex fraud investigations at any given time to ensure timely progression and resolution.                Maintain personal accreditation and training requirements to ensure competence in investigative practices.

You will also gain knowledge, skills and experience from working alongside approved contractors who regularly attend site to undertake specialised works, therefore an inquisitive approach and ability to learn will assist as FM is a constantly evolving industry.

Civil Enforcement Officers (CEO) will also be required to issue Penalty Charge Notices to vehicles parking in contravention of the parking regulations, which may incur some negative verbal interaction.

On a daily basis CEO's will walk their allocated route, which could be up to 10/12 miles, assessing road signage and road lining for compliance purposes; informing their supervisor of any issues or concerns. CEO's must ensure all incidents are brought to the attention of the Supervisor immediately – providing written statements and reports. They may also need to attend court or adjudication panels when required, as well as to submit evidence when called upon. Medway Council's equipment procedures must be adhered to – ensuring that all equipment is given due care and protection, daily start of shift checks should be carried out for faults and damaged equipment to be immediately reported to the Supervisor.  CEO's will be required to assist with the clearing of snow from Medway car park surfaces as directed, if the weather inhibits the issuing of Penalty Charge Notices.

Level C requires the highest level of competence and applicants would need to fully meet and demonstrate all aspects of the job profile, including qualifications, knowledge, skills and experience. Parking Enforcement are seeking a Civil Enforcement Officer to join the team at level A. This is the entry point of the role, so you will need to be able to demonstrate the relevant knowledge, experience and skills to get you started, but you will be supported to develop in your role through induction, probation and a supportive Performance Appraisal and Career Conversation.
