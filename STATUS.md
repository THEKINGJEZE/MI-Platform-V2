# MI Platform — Session Status

**Updated**: 19 January 2025
**Phase**: 1 — Core Jobs Pipeline (completing)
**Session Goal**: Comprehensive Review — Skills Integration & Spec Simplification

---

## 🎯 Immediate Next Action

> **Fix WF2/WF4 bugs** — E2E test revealed deduplication and consolidation issues
>
> Phase 1 pipeline works but has bugs. Dashboard spec simplified. Skills documented.
>
> **Before dashboard**: Complete Phase 1 properly.

**Blockers**: WF2 deduplication bug, WF4 consolidation bug (see PHASE-1-E2E-TEST.md)

**Next step**: Debug WF2 deduplication logic, then WF4 consolidation.

## 📊 Phase Progress

```
Phase 1: [████████░░] 85% — Core Jobs Pipeline

  ✅ Airtable schema (4 tables, 48 forces)
  ✅ WF1: Jobs Trigger
  ✅ WF2: Jobs Receiver (⚠️ dedup bug)
  ✅ WF3: Jobs Classifier
  ⚠️ WF4: Opportunity Creator (consolidation bug)
  ✅ WF5: Opportunity Enricher
  ✅ WF6: Send Outreach
  
  Remaining:
  □ Fix WF2 + WF4 bugs
  □ Complete E2E test
  □ Phase 1 sign-off

Phase 1c: [██████░░░░] 60% — Dashboard MVP

  ✅ SPEC-007b written
  ✅ Next.js app exists (from SPEC-007)
  □ Schema fields added
  □ Aligned to SPEC-007b
  □ Timing validated
  □ Deployed

Future (Deferred):
  ⏸️ SPEC-007a: Full UI (needs scoring)
  ⏸️ SPEC-008: Morning Brief (needs infrastructure)
```

## 🏗️ Schema Status

**Current (4 tables)**:
- Forces: 48 records ✅
- Signals: Active ✅
- Opportunities: Active ✅
- Contacts: Ready ✅

**Phase 1c additions needed**:
- [ ] Opportunities.draft_subject
- [ ] Opportunities.draft_body
- [ ] Opportunities.actioned_at
- [ ] Opportunities.skip_reason

## 💡 Decisions Made This Session

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Created SPEC-007b (Dashboard MVP) | SPEC-007a requires schema expansion V2 doesn't have |
| Deferred SPEC-007a | Dual-track scoring needs Phase 1b + schema fields |
| Deferred SPEC-008 | Morning Brief needs overnight tracking infrastructure |
| Created skills/README.md | Skills are reference, not requirements |
| Updated ROADMAP with evolution paths | Future features documented, won't be forgotten |

**Log in DECISIONS.md**: Yes, after this session.

---

## ⚠️ Blockers

1. **WF2 Deduplication** — Allowing duplicates through
2. **WF4 Consolidation** — Not grouping signals correctly

See `specs/PHASE-1-E2E-TEST.md` for details.

## 🚨 Mission Reminder

*From [ANCHOR.md](ANCHOR.md):*
- 3-5 ready-to-send leads every Monday
- ≤15 min review time  
- Reduce James's cognitive load

**Today's simplification serves the mission**: Build what works with current schema, defer complexity that requires infrastructure we don't have.
