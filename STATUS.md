## ✅ Done Previous Session (19 Jan)

### Bug Status Update
- [x] Investigated WF2/WF4 bugs — discovered already fixed on 18 Jan
- [x] Verified fixes in workflow JSON files (returnAll=true, ARRAYJOIN formula)
- [x] Updated STATUS.md to reflect current state

### Documentation Audit
- [x] Ran /doc-audit comprehensive alignment check
- [x] Generated docs/AUDIT-REPORT.md with 40 issues (11 high, 17 medium, 12 low)
- [x] Fixed 7 spec headers to match ROADMAP status
- [x] Fixed SPEC-004 wrong table ID (tbl3qHi21UzKqMXWo → tblJgZuI3LM2Az5id)
- [x] Updated ROADMAP SPEC-005 status (Next → Built)
- [x] Fixed 5 broken file references (specs/README.md, dashboard-v1-review.md, consistency-checker.md, SPEC-001, SPEC-002)

**Key audit findings ✅ RESOLVED:**
1. ~~7 spec headers misaligned~~ → Fixed
2. ~~SPEC-004 wrong table ID~~ → Fixed
3. ~~SPEC-005 status conflict~~ → Fixed (ROADMAP updated to Built)
4. SPEC-005 missing sales guardrails G-012 through G-015 (medium priority — deferred)
5. Global ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md references different Airtable base (acceptable — different project)

**Mission alignment check**: No drift from ANCHOR.md mission detected. All issues are documentation hygiene, not mission deviation. The platform still targets 3-5 leads, ≤15 min review, ADHD-first design.

### Strategy Document Integration
- [x] Integrated strategy docs from Claude Chat Project Knowledge to filesystem
- [x] Cleaned Section 11 duplicate content (removed old vertical scroll remnants)
- [x] Added Sales Strategy reference to Section 7
- [x] Added guardrail references (G-012 through G-015) to workflow 4.1 in Section 10
- [x] Added supplementary docs reference to Section 12
- [x] Updated CHAT-INSTRUCTIONS.md with filesystem locations
- [x] Updated DEPENDENCY-MAP.md with strategy doc change impact rules
- [x] Deleted strategy-section-11-update.md (content merged)

### Spec Restructuring
- [x] Created SPEC-007b: Dashboard MVP (simplified Three-Zone layout)
- [x] Updated SPEC-007a to "Future Phase" with prerequisites
- [x] Updated SPEC-008 to "Future Phase" with prerequisites
- [x] Created skills/README.md with usage guide
- [x] Updated ROADMAP.md with schema evolution path
- [x] Updated ROADMAP.md with dashboard evolution path

### Skills Migration (Previous Session)
- [x] Migrated 13 skills from V1 to `skills/` folder
- [x] Updated CLAUDE.md with skills table

### Developer Tooling
- [x] Created `/doc-audit` slash command — multi-agent documentation alignment audit
- [x] Created 5 audit subagents (reference-integrity, single-source-truth, roadmap-alignment, schema-alignment, guardrail-compliance)
- [x] Updated CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE-CODE-CAPABILITIES.md with new command

### Dashboard Build (Previous Session)
- [x] Built Next.js 14 dashboard (SPEC-007)
- [x] Note: Dashboard exists but spec has been restructured

## 🏗️ Schema Status

**Current (4 tables)**:
- Forces: 48 records ✅
- Signals: Active ✅
- Opportunities: Active ✅
- Contacts: Ready ✅

**Phase 1c schema compatibility** (Stage 2 AUDIT finding):

| SPEC-007b Field | Actual Airtable Field | Status |
|-----------------|----------------------|--------|
| draft_subject | subject_line | ✅ Mapped in code |
| draft_body | outreach_draft | ✅ Mapped in code |
| actioned_at | sent_at | ✅ Mapped in code |
| skip_reason | skipped_reason | ✅ Mapped in code |

No schema changes needed — fields exist with slightly different names. Code maps them in `mapOpportunityToReview()` function.

## 💡 Decisions Made This Session

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Created SPEC-007b (Dashboard MVP) | SPEC-007a requires schema expansion V2 doesn't have |
| Deferred SPEC-007a | Dual-track scoring needs Phase 1b + schema fields |
| Deferred SPEC-008 | Morning Brief needs overnight tracking infrastructure |
| Created skills/README.md | Skills are reference, not requirements |
| Updated ROADMAP with evolution paths | Future features documented, won't be forgotten |

**Log in DECISIONS.md**: Yes, after this session.

## ⚠️ Blockers

None — SPEC-007b verified and ready for deployment.

See `specs/PHASE-1-E2E-TEST.md` for test results (Tests 1-6 passing).

## 🚨 Mission Reminder

*From [ANCHOR.md](ANCHOR.md):*
- 3-5 ready-to-send leads every Monday
- ≤15 min review time  
- Reduce James's cognitive load

**Today's simplification serves the mission**: Build what works with current schema, defer complexity that requires infrastructure we don't have.
