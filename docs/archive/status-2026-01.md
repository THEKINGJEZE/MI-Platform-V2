## Session Work (23 Jan)

### Enhanced /audit-claude-setup with validation layer ✅

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `.claude/agents/config-auditor.md` | Added validation checks (CLAUDE.md, settings, hooks, skills, agents, commands, security, consistency) + health scoring |
| `.claude/agents/improvement-planner.md` | Added 🔴 Critical tier for broken configs, updated prioritisation |
| `.claude/commands/audit-claude-setup.md` | Added Setup Health Check section with overall status, critical issues, warnings, validation summary |

**New capabilities:**
- Health score (0-10) based on validation results
- Distinguishes "broken" (critical) from "could be better" (improvements)
- Security checks included in every audit
- Failed validations include specific fix instructions with file paths

### Updated /audit-claude-setup subagents to Opus 4.5 ✅

All three subagents now use `claude-opus-4-5-20251101` for better quality analysis:
- `docs-fetcher.md`
- `config-auditor.md`
- `improvement-planner.md`

| Add weekly maintenance checklist | ✅ /doc-audit, /hygiene-check, /health-check |
| Update session protocol with checkpointing | ✅ Checkpoint before risky edits |
| Update CHAT-INSTRUCTIONS.md | ✅ Capabilities Gate section added |

**Phase 2 (Synchronization):**

- Cross-document facts: Aligned + auto-sync enabled
- Agent usage: Mandatory protocols documented
- Weekly maintenance: Checklist defined + Monday reminder active
- Phase sync: Automatic via PostToolUse hook
- Documentation audit: Fresh report generated, 50% issue reduction
- Schema evolution: Phase 1d fields documented in SPEC-001 + ROADMAP

## Session Work (21 Jan - Late Afternoon)

### Deployment ✅
- ✅ Deployed MI: Jobs Classifier (w4Mw2wX9wBeimYP2) — 19 nodes, active
- ✅ Deployed MI: Jobs Receiver (nGBkihJb6279HOHD) — 17 nodes, active
- ✅ All workflows running on schedule

### Data Cleanup Executed ✅
- ✅ `cleanup-signals.js`: 8 false positives marked irrelevant
- ✅ `merge-opportunities.js`: 23 signals merged, 17 duplicate opps archived (47→30)
- ✅ `recompute-priorities.js`: 9 competitor opps upgraded to P1/Hot

### End-to-End Verification ✅
- ✅ Opportunity Creator (WF4): Running successfully, status=success
- ✅ Competitor intercepts properly flagged: `is_competitor_intercept=true`, `priority_tier=hot`
- ✅ Examples verified: Kent Police, West Midlands, Nottinghamshire all P1/Hot
- ✅ Classifier (WF3): Error fixed — was sending invalid `force_source='existing'` to Airtable

### Git Commit ✅
- Commit b949000 pushed to GitHub with all Quality Improvement changes

## Verified Metrics (21 Jan)

| Metric | Before | After | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Duplicate opportunities | 47 | 30 | 1 per force | ✅ Merged |
| Competitor opps P1/Hot | 22% | 100% | 100% | ✅ Fixed |
| Bright Data errors cleared | 2 | 0 | 0 | ✅ Cleaned |

---

## Known Issue (21 Jan)

**WF3 Classifier ends in "error" status** despite processing signals correctly:
- Signals are being classified with role_type, seniority, ai_confidence
- Status updates to relevant/irrelevant work
- May be timeout when processing 40+ signals in continuous loop
- Not blocking — signals still get processed
