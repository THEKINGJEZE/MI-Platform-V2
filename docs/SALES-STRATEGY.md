# MI Platform — Sales Strategy

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 19 January 2025  
**Purpose**: Define how the MI Platform identifies, prioritises, and approaches opportunities. This document governs contact selection, messaging, and follow-up cadence.

## Core Philosophy

### Job Postings Are Warm Leads, Not Classifications

When we detect a job posting (direct or via competitor), we are not trying to decide "is this Agency or Managed Services?" We are identifying:

1. **A force with an active need** — they're hiring because they have a problem
2. **An opportunity to make contact** — the job posting is the hook
3. **A conversation to have** — let the dialogue determine the right solution

The job posting opens the door. Peel's value proposition is what we bring through it.

### We Present Our Full Capability

Every outreach presents Peel's solution framework, not a narrow service offer:

> "We help forces enhance operational capacity and build organisational capability through tailored, outcome-based solutions."

We never lead with "we have candidates" — that's a commodity conversation. We lead with the problem we solve and let the force determine which service fits their situation.

### Competitor Signals = Confirmed Opportunity

When a competitor posts a job for a police force:
- The force has a confirmed, active requirement
- The force has allocated budget
- The force is actively engaging suppliers
- **Peel should be part of that conversation**

This is not about displacement or criticising existing suppliers. It's about ensuring Peel is on the table while the force is actively looking.

## Lead Prioritisation Model

### Priority Tiers

| Priority | Signal Pattern | Response Window | Rationale |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|
| 🔴 **P1 — Hot** | Competitor posting | Same day | Force is actively engaging suppliers now |
| 🔴 **P1 — Hot** | Direct posting + urgent language ("immediate start", "ASAP", "backlog") | Same day | Time pressure indicates acute need |
| 🟠 **P2 — Warm** | Direct posting + volume (appears to be multiple roles) | Within 48 hours | Scale suggests capacity conversation |
| 🟠 **P2 — Warm** | Direct posting + senior/specialist role (Head of, Manager, Lead) | Within 48 hours | Strategic hire indicates change |
| 🟡 **P3 — Standard** | Direct posting, standard | Within 1 week | Opportunity to introduce Peel |
| 🟡 **P3 — Standard** | Direct posting, aged 30+ days | Within 1 week | Struggling to fill — different approach may appeal |

### Priority Signals in Detail

**Competitor Posting (P1)**
- Source: Red Snapper, Investigo, Reed, Adecco, Service Care, Matrix SCM
- Why high priority: Confirmed need + budget + active supplier engagement
- Not because: Supplier is failing (we don't assume this)

**Urgent Language (P1)**
- Triggers: "Immediate start", "ASAP", "Urgent", "Backlog", "Must hold vetting"
- Why high priority: Time pressure means faster decisions
- Note: "Immediate start" + "Must hold vetting" is strongest signal — they can't wait for vetting process

**Volume Indicators (P2)**
- Triggers: Multiple similar roles, "x3", "multiple positions", "team of"
- Why high priority: Volume suggests structural capacity gap, not just backfill
- Note: Even a single job ad may be for multiple positions — the advert text often reveals this

**Specialist/Senior Roles (P2)**
- Triggers: Head of, Manager, Lead, Detective Chief Inspector, Superintendent
- Why high priority: Strategic hires often indicate organisational change or new priorities
- Opportunity: Conversation about what's driving the change

## Contact Strategy

### Principle: Contact the Problem Owner

The right contact is whoever owns the problem that the job posting signals — not necessarily who posted the job.

| Role Being Hired | Problem Domain | Target Contact |
|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| PIP2 Investigators | Investigation capacity | Head of Crime / Detective Chief Superintendent / Head of Investigations |
| Digital Forensics Examiner | Forensic backlog | Head of Digital/Cyber / Forensic Services Manager |
| Intelligence Analyst | Intelligence capability | Head of Intelligence / Detective Superintendent Intelligence |
| Disclosure Officer | Case progression / CJ backlog | Head of Criminal Justice / CJ Partnership Manager |
| HOLMES Indexer | Major Incident capacity | Head of Major Crime / Senior Investigating Officer cadre lead |
| Financial Investigator | Economic crime / POCA | Head of Economic Crime / Financial Investigation Unit Manager |
| Statement Taker / Case Builder | Volume crime capacity | Head of Volume Crime / Local Policing Commander |
| Generic investigative support | Varies | Start with Head of Crime, may need discovery |

### Contact Hierarchy

1. **Primary**: Problem owner (operational leader)
2. **Secondary**: Their deputy or direct report
3. **Fallback**: HR/Recruitment (if we cannot identify problem owner)

When contacting HR as fallback, the message should still present Peel's value proposition, not "we have candidates." HR can route us to the right conversation.

### Finding Contacts

**Sources (in order of reliability):**
1. Existing Peel relationships (check HubSpot)
2. LinkedIn (search force name + role title)
3. Force website (leadership team pages, FOI disclosure logs)
4. Police.uk / College of Policing directories
5. Conference speaker lists, publications, LinkedIn posts

**If contact not found:**
- Flag opportunity for manual research
- Use HR/Recruitment as interim contact
- Note in opportunity record: "Contact TBC — HR approach as interim"

## Messaging Framework

### Structure: Hook → Bridge → Value → CTA

Every outreach follows this structure:

1. **Hook**: Reference the specific signal (job posting, requirement)
2. **Bridge**: Acknowledge the challenge they're facing
3. **Value**: Present Peel's approach (outcome-based, accountable, tailored)
4. **CTA**: Request a conversation (not a transaction)

### Template: Standard Signal (Direct Posting)

**Subject**: Supporting [Force] with [role type / capability area]

> I noticed [Force] is recruiting for [role/s]. Many forces we work with face similar [capacity pressures / backlog challenges / specialist recruitment difficulties] — [brief context on the common challenge].
>
> Peel Solutions specialises in helping forces address these challenges. We provide [managed investigator teams / specialist capability / tailored resourcing solutions] focused on delivering outcomes, not just filling seats. Our approach means we take accountability for delivery while your leadership focuses on strategic priorities.
>
> I'd welcome the opportunity to introduce Peel and understand your current situation. Would you be open to a brief conversation?

### Template: Urgent Signal (Immediate Start / Backlog Language)

**Subject**: Immediate support for [Force] — [role type]

> I saw [Force] is looking for [role/s] with an urgent start. When forces face this kind of time pressure, traditional recruitment timelines often can't keep pace.
>
> Peel Solutions maintains a network of vetted, cleared professionals who can mobilise quickly. More importantly, we can discuss whether a fully managed approach might address the underlying capacity challenge — taking the recruitment and management burden off your team entirely.
>
> Given the urgency, would a call this week be possible?

### Template: Competitor Signal

**Subject**: Supporting [Force] with [capability area]

> I noticed you're recruiting for [role/s] and wanted to make sure Peel Solutions is on your radar.
>
> We specialise in supporting forces with [investigation capacity / forensic capability / etc.] through outcome-based delivery. Whether you're looking to supplement your current arrangements or explore a different approach, we'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how we might help.
>
> Would you be open to a brief introductory conversation?

**Key points:**
- No criticism of existing suppliers
- Positions Peel as additive ("supplement your current arrangements")
- Opens door to broader conversation ("explore a different approach")

### Template: Volume Signal (Multiple Roles)

**Subject**: [Force] investigator capacity — Peel Solutions

> I noticed [Force] is recruiting for multiple [investigator / analyst / specialist] roles. When forces are scaling up capacity at this level, we often find there's a broader conversation to be had about sustainable delivery models.
>
> Peel Solutions provides managed investigator teams under a Statement of Works — we take accountability for outcomes, manage the team, and you direct the work. Several forces have found this approach more effective than recruiting at scale, particularly when experienced staff are hard to find and retain.
>
> I'd be interested to understand what's driving your current requirements. Would you have time for a conversation?

### Template: HR Fallback (When Problem Owner Unknown)

**Subject**: Peel Solutions — supporting [Force] recruitment

> I noticed [Force] is recruiting for [role/s] and wanted to introduce Peel Solutions.
>
> We work with police forces across the UK, providing specialist [investigation / forensic / intelligence] capability. Our approach ranges from individual placements to fully managed teams — depending on what the force needs.
>
> I'd welcome the opportunity to introduce our services and understand who might be the right person to speak with about your current requirements. Would you be able to point me in the right direction?

## Follow-Up Cadence

### Standard Cadence (P2/P3 Signals)

| Touch | Timing | Channel | Content |
|-------|--------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Day 0 | Email | Initial outreach (templates above) |
| 2 | Day 3 | LinkedIn | Connection request + brief note |
| 3 | Day 7 | Email | Follow-up, add value (insight, case study) |
| 4 | Day 14 | Phone | Call attempt (leave voicemail if no answer) |
| 5 | Day 21 | Email | Final follow-up, leave door open |

**After 5 touches with no response**: Mark as "No Response" and move to nurture track (quarterly check-in).

### Accelerated Cadence (P1 Signals — Hot)

| Touch | Timing | Channel | Content |
|-------|--------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Day 0 | Email | Initial outreach |
| 2 | Day 0/1 | LinkedIn | Connection request + message |
| 3 | Day 1 | Phone | Call attempt |
| 4 | Day 2 | Email | Follow-up |
| 5 | Day 4 | Phone | Second call attempt |
| 6 | Day 7 | Email | Final follow-up |

**Rationale**: P1 signals indicate time-sensitive need. Faster cadence ensures we're in the conversation before decisions are made.

### Follow-Up Content Guidelines

**Touch 2-3: Add Value**
- Share relevant insight ("We've seen several forces tackle [X] by...")
- Reference case study (anonymised if needed)
- Offer something useful ("Happy to share how [similar force] approached this")

**Touch 4-5: Create Closure**
- Acknowledge they're busy
- Restate value briefly
- Leave door open ("If circumstances change...")
- Don't be pushy or desperate

## Competitor Response Protocol

### When We Detect a Competitor Posting

1. **Immediately flag as P1** — same-day response required
2. **Research the force** — any existing Peel relationship? Recent activity?
3. **Identify contact** — problem owner, not just HR
4. **Send collaborative outreach** — "make sure we're on your radar" positioning
5. **Accelerated follow-up cadence** — 6 touches over 7 days

### Competitor-Specific Intelligence

| Competitor | Typical Clients | Notes |
|------------|----------------|-------|
| Red Snapper | Various forces | Long-standing police sector presence |
| Investigo | Various forces | Growing police sector focus |
| Reed | Framework supplier | Often via BlueLight Commercial |
| Adecco | BLC Tier 1 | Primary MSP on many frameworks |
| Service Care | Specialist roles | Strong in forensics, analysts |
| Matrix SCM | Neutral vendor | Platform-based, various forces |

**When we see these competitors active**: It confirms the force is engaging suppliers. We should be in the mix.

### What We Don't Do

- ❌ Criticise competitors in outreach
- ❌ Assume the competitor is failing
- ❌ Position as "replacement"
- ✅ Position as "additional option"
- ✅ Focus on Peel's value, not competitor weaknesses

---

## Service Positioning

### We Don't Pre-Classify Opportunities

The MI Platform does not try to determine "is this MS or Agency?" at the signal stage. Instead:

1. All signals are "force has a need"
2. Outreach presents Peel's full capability
3. Conversation determines the right solution

### Peel's Solution Framework (From Brand Guide)

**Solution Area 1: Enhancing Operational Capacity**
- Outcome-Based Project Delivery (Peel Teams) — managed teams, accountable for outcomes
- Staffing Solutions — individual professionals to augment client teams

**Solution Area 2: Building Organisational Capability**
- Formal Learning & Development
- Capability Transfer via Project Delivery

**Solution Area 3: Improving Performance & Compliance**
- Consultancy & Advisory
- Performance Uplift via Project Delivery

### In Practice

Most conversations will focus on Solution Area 1 (Capacity), because that's what job postings signal. But we should be alert to cues that indicate Solution Area 2 or 3 needs:

| Cue in Conversation | Potential Solution Area |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| "We can't retain experienced staff" | 2 — L&D, mentoring |
| "HMICFRS flagged our investigations" | 3 — Consultancy, review |
| "We need to clear a backlog but also improve quality" | 1 + 3 — Peel Team with performance focus |
| "We're restructuring the department" | 3 — Advisory support |

## Metrics & Review

### Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Response rate | >15% | Are we reaching the right people with the right message? |
| P1 same-day response | 100% | Are we acting on hot signals fast enough? |
| Conversation rate | >5% of outreach | Are messages converting to calls? |
| Pipeline generated | 3-5 qualified opps/week | Is the system delivering? |

### Weekly Review (Monday Morning)

During the Monday review:
1. Review new P1 signals first
2. Review P2 signals second
3. Approve/edit messages
4. Send or schedule
5. Review follow-up queue

### Monthly Review

1. Which signal types are converting best?
2. Which message templates are working?
3. Which contacts are responding?
4. Adjust prioritisation weights if needed

## Integration with MI Platform

### How This Strategy Connects to Specs

| Spec | Relevant Strategy Element |
|------|--------------------------|
| SPEC-003 (Classification) | Priority tier assignment based on signal patterns |
| SPEC-004 (Opportunity Creator) | Opportunity created for each force with active signals |
| SPEC-005 (Enrichment) | Contact identification using problem owner logic; message drafting using templates |
| SPEC-006/007b (Monday Review) | Priority queue presentation; message editing before send |

### Guardrails for Enrichment (WF5)

When implementing the enrichment workflow:

- **G-XXX**: Always draft messages using the Hook → Bridge → Value → CTA structure
- **G-XXX**: Never lead with "we have candidates" — always lead with Peel's value proposition
- **G-XXX**: Contact target is problem owner; HR is fallback only
- **G-XXX**: Competitor signals get P1 priority automatically
- **G-XXX**: Message tone is collaborative, not aggressive or critical of competitors

### AI Prompt Guidance

When Claude API drafts messages, the prompt should include:

> Draft an outreach message for [Force] regarding their [role] requirement.
>
> Structure: Hook (reference the job) → Bridge (acknowledge challenge) → Value (Peel's outcome-based approach) → CTA (request conversation).
>
> Tone: Professional, collaborative, focused on understanding their needs. Do not criticise any existing suppliers. Position Peel as an additional option or different approach, not a replacement.
>
> Keep the message concise (under 150 words). End with a clear call to action requesting a conversation.

## Document Maintenance

This document should be updated when:
- Response rates indicate messaging isn't working
- New competitor patterns emerge
- Peel's service offering changes
- Contact strategy proves ineffective for certain role types

**Owner**: James (Commercial)  
**Review frequency**: Monthly, or after significant learning
