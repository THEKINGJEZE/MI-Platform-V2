## What Makes a Dashboard "Best in Class"

A dashboard earns "best in class" when it behaves like a **daily decision system**:

1. **Starts with a queue, not a collage** — Ranked "what to do next" with *why* and *next action*
2. **Blends three signals into one priority** — Fit + Intent + Timing
3. **Explains the model** — Transparent scoring, not black-box rankings
4. **Minimises context switching** — Outreach actions happen inline
5. **Uses AI as co-pilot** — Message drafting, research synthesis
6. **Provides confidence indicators** — Data freshness, verification status


## 10 Patterns That Win

### Pattern 1: Ranked Queue + Reason Codes

**Instead of:** Flat list sorted by name
**Do this:** Ranked queue with rank, score, "why now" badges, recommended action

### Pattern 2: Explainable Scoring

**Instead of:** Black-box AI score
**Do this:** Contribution breakdown with positive and negative factors

### Pattern 3: Inline Outreach Actions

**Instead of:** Navigate to CRM/email to act
**Do this:** Email, Call, LinkedIn buttons directly on lead card

### Pattern 4: Signal Badges with Directionality

**Instead of:** Static labels
**Do this:** Badges showing state AND trajectory (`[Hiring ↑]`, `[Cooling ↓]`)

### Pattern 5: AI-Seeded Message Drafts

**Instead of:** Blank compose window
**Do this:** Pre-drafted message using detected signals as personalisation hooks

### Pattern 6: Data Confidence Indicators

**Instead of:** Treating all data equally
**Do this:** Visual indicators for verification level and freshness

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| ✓ Verified (green) | Phone/email confirmed working |
| ⚠ Unverified (yellow) | Data present but not validated |
| 🕐 Stale (grey) | Last updated >90 days ago |
| 💎 Diamond | Premium verified mobile |

### Pattern 7: Multi-Signal Score Card

**Instead of:** Single score number
**Do this:** Visual breakdown of Fit, Intent, Timing, Relationship dimensions

### Pattern 8: Keyboard-First Power User Mode

**Instead of:** Mouse-only navigation
**Do this:** Full keyboard navigation with visible shortcuts

### Pattern 9: The "Today" Queue

**Instead of:** Static list requiring user prioritisation
**Do this:** Auto-generated "What I need to do today" view

### Pattern 10: Trigger-Based Alert Cards

**Instead of:** Passive data user must discover
**Do this:** Proactive alerts when signals detected with "Why it matters" and suggested action

## The Ultimate Test

**Time to Insight:** The winner is not the platform with the *most* data, but the one that most quickly translates a signal into a completed action.

The dashboard of the future is not a place to *look* — it is a place to *decide*.
