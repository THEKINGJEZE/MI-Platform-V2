# UK Police Market Domain Knowledge

Domain expertise for interpreting UK police recruitment market signals and calibrating detection thresholds.

## Quick Reference

### Workforce Composition (March 2024)
- **Officers:** ~147,000 (72% of workforce) — hold Office of Constable, general powers
- **Police Staff:** ~28% — civilian employees, can be designated specific powers under Section 38 Police Reform Act 2002
- **Contractors/Agency:** used for surge capacity and specialist skills, constrained by vetting and system access

### The "Juniorisation" Problem
35% of officers have <5 years service. Creates:
- Supervision gap (inexperienced sergeants)
- Poor case file quality → CPS rejections
- Demand for external mentors, case-builders, disclosure officers

### PIP Accreditation (Market Currency)
| Level | Scope | Outsourcing Signal |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| PIP 1 | Volume/priority crime | High-volume, lower-margin roles |
| PIP 2 | Serious/complex crime (robbery, GBH, RASSO, fraud) | **Core market** — highest demand |
| PIP 3 | Major crime (SIO-led: homicide, kidnapping) | Premium rates, operation-specific |

"PIP2 accredited" in a posting = materially different signal than generic "investigator".

### Vetting Levels
| Level | Access | Lead Time |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| NPPV 1 | Premises only | Days |
| NPPV 2 | Limited systems | Weeks |
| NPPV 3 | PNC, PND, case files | Weeks–months |
| SC | Counter-terrorism, ROCU | Months |
| DV | Top Secret | 6+ months |

**Key insight:** "Must hold NPPV3/SC" = force wants access-ready candidates. Strong buying intent.

- **Signal interpretation, thresholds:** See [references/signal-interpretation.md](references/signal-interpretation.md)

## Core Interpretation Rules

### HMICFRS Triggers
Forces rated "Inadequate" or "Requires Improvement" in:
- **Investigating Crime** → demand for PIP 2 investigators, case review teams
- **Responding to Public** → demand for call handlers, control room staff
- **Protecting Vulnerable People** → demand for PPU investigators, safeguarding researchers

**Engage status** (special measures) = "distress signal" — forces access reserves/grants for immediate fixes.

**Current Engage forces (2024/25):** Met, West Midlands, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire.

### Fiscal Seasonality
| Period | Behaviour |
|--------|-----------|
| Jan–Mar | Budget flush — short-term projects invoiced before year-end |
| Apr–Jun | New contracts commence, new funding released |
| Jul–Sep | Summer surge → backlogs grow |
| Oct–Dec | Mid-year review — recovery plans if metrics off-track |

### Force Size Heuristics
| Size | Normal Posting Rate | Surge Signal |
|------|---------------------|--------------|
| Large (Met, GMP, WMP) | 1–4/week | ≥6 unique investigator posts in 7 days |
| Medium | 0–2/week | ≥3 unique investigator posts in 7 days |
| Small | 0/week typical | ≥2 in one week |

## High-Intent Signal Combinations

Highest outsourcing intent when factors combine:
1. Repeat/re-advertising same role (2+ cycles)
2. Contract/fixed-term investigator posting
3. "Must hold NPPV/SC" + "immediate start"
4. Specialist demand: PIP2, digital forensics, disclosure, RASSO
5. HMICFRS remediation deadline within 6 months

**Low-intent:** Rolling recruitment, talent pools — noise unless paired with start windows.
