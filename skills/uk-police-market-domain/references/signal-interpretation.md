# Signal Interpretation and Threshold Calibration

## High-Intent Signal Patterns

### Pattern 1: Repeat/Re-advertising
Same role posted repeatedly across 2+ advert cycles.
- **Interpretation:** Supply-constrained; force cannot fill internally
- **Signal strength:** High, especially for specialist roles

### Pattern 2: Contract/Fixed-Term in Investigation Functions
- Often reflects urgent demand, backfill, or backlog
- IR35 can often be structured outside for managed services

### Pattern 3: Clearance + Speed Language
"Must hold NPPV/SC" combined with "immediate start"
- **Interpretation:** "We need deployable capacity now"

### Pattern 4: HMICFRS Remediation Language
References to improvement plans, investigation quality, supervision, victim contact timeliness, disclosure compliance

## Threshold Calibration

### Hiring Surge Threshold

| Force Size | Threshold |
|------------|-----------|
| Small/Medium | ≥3 unique investigator-role postings in 7 days |
| Large | ≥6 unique investigator-role postings in 7 days |

### Persistent Vacancy Threshold

| Role Type | Persistent If |
|-----------|---------------|
| Permanent staff | Open ≥45 days, OR re-advertised ≥2 times within 120 days |
| Contract roles | Open ≥30 days, OR re-advertised within 60–90 days |
| High-clearance (SC/DV/NPPV3) | Extend windows by +15–30 days |

## Buying-Intent Score

| Signal | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Repeat posting within 90d (same fingerprint) | +3 |
| Contract/fixed-term investigator role posted | +3 |
| Requires NPPV/SC (access-ready constraint) | +2 |
| HMICFRS remediation deadline in next 6 months | +2 |
| Surge trigger hit | +2 |
| ≥2 agencies posting same role in 14d | +1 |
| Premium rate ≥15% | +1 |

### Interpretation

| Score | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 0–3 | Baseline noise | Monitor |
| 4–7 | Warm — likely staffing friction | Engage proactively |
| 8+ | Hot — high probability of external purchase | Priority outreach |

## False Positive Avoidance

### Rolling Recruitment / Talent Pools
- Treat as low signal by default
- Only upgrade if paired with confirmed start windows, named unit, or HMICFRS context

### "Urgent" Language
- Often recruiter wording style, not genuine urgency
- Only strong when paired with contract type, clearance requirement, or repeat adverts
