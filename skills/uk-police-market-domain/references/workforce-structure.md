# Workforce Structure and Legal Frameworks

## Workforce Categories

### Warranted Officers (~72% of workforce)
Hold the Office of Constable — independent officers of the Crown with general policing powers (arrest, search, seizure).

### Police Staff (~28% of workforce)
Civilian employees. Can be designated specific powers under Section 38 Police Reform Act 2002.

### Contractors/Agency Staff
Used for surge capacity and specialist skills. Operationally constrained by:
- Vetting/clearance timelines (weeks to months)
- System access requirements (PNC, case management)
- Supervision ratios and audit requirements

## Section 38 Designated Powers

The Police Reform Act 2002 Section 38 enables Chief Constables to designate civilians (including contractor employees) with specific powers.

### Designatable Roles

| Role | Powers | Outsourcing Potential |
|------|--------|----------------------|
| **Investigating Officer** | Execute Section 8 PACE search warrants, seize evidence, interview suspects | **High** — core Peel market |
| **Detention Officer** | Search detainees, take fingerprints/DNA, manage custody | Often outsourced to FM providers |
| **Escort Officer** | Transport prisoners | Moderate |

**Market signal:** "Section 38 Designation" in a job spec = role is suitable for external agency fulfillment.

## PIP Accreditation Framework

### PIP 1: Priority and Volume Crime
- Theft, assault without injury, criminal damage
- High-volume, lower-margin placements

### PIP 2: Serious and Complex Crime
**The core market for agency intervention.**
- Robbery, GBH, RASSO, complex fraud
- National shortage of PIP 2 accredited detectives
- 18–24 month lead time to train new detective

### PIP 3: Major Crime (SIOs)
- Senior Investigating Officers for homicide, kidnapping
- Fewer positions, higher rates
- Often operation-specific hiring

## Vetting System

### NPPV (Non-Police Personnel Vetting)

| Level | Access | Timeline |
|-------|--------|----------|
| NPPV 1 | Premises only | Days |
| NPPV 2 | Limited systems | Weeks |
| NPPV 3 | PNC, PND, case files | Weeks–months |

### National Security Vetting

| Level | Access |
|-------|--------|
| SC (Security Check) | Counter-terrorism, ROCU roles |
| DV (Developed Vetting) | Top Secret |

### The Portability Problem
Forces are risk-averse, often require "Health Check" or full re-vetting even for transferred clearances.

**Strategic advantage:** Candidates with current, transferable NPPV3 can charge premium for "immediate start" capability.

## Civilianised Roles

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| Police Staff Investigator (PSI) | Case-building, interviewing |
| Disclosure Officer | CPIA compliance |
| Intelligence Analyst | Pattern analysis |
| Digital Forensic Examiner | Device examination |
| Financial Investigator | Proceeds of crime |
| Case Builder | File preparation for CPS |
