# Hiring Baselines and Seasonality

## Structural Hiring Patterns

### Lead Time Characteristics
- **Police officer recruitment:** ~6 months end-to-end (public guidance)
- **Police staff hiring:** Faster than officers but bottlenecked by vetting
- **Typical pattern:** Advert window → Interview → Conditional offer → Vetting/medical → Start date
- Vetting can take "weeks or even months" depending on level

### Current Workforce Context
- Police Uplift Programme delivered ~147,000 officers (March 2024)
- 35% of officers have <5 years service ("Juniorisation")
- ~6.0–6.2% annual attrition rate
- Neighbourhood Policing Guarantee (Dec 2024) shifting internal allocation

## Fiscal Seasonality

Police budgets: hybrid of Central Government Grant + Council Tax Precept. Financial year: 1 April – 31 March.

| Period | Budget Behaviour | Staffing Implications |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Jan–Mar (Q4)** | Year-end review, underspend conversion | Peak for 3-month backlog clearance projects; "use it or lose it" spending |
| **Apr–Jun (Q1)** | New financial year, new funding | Large managed service contracts commence; framework awards |
| **Jul–Sep** | Summer surge (festivals, night economy, public order) | Response officers abstracted from investigations → backlogs grow; demand for "backfill" investigators post-surge |
| **Oct–Dec (Q3)** | Mid-year performance review | Recovery plans if metrics off-track; resource augmentation |

### Budget Flush Timing
**High-probability window:** 15 January – 28 February

## Force Size Baselines

### Large Forces (Met, GMP, WMP, West Yorkshire, Thames Valley)
- **Normal:** 1–4 unique investigator-role postings/week
- **Noteworthy:** Sustained 5–10/week

### Medium Forces
- **Normal:** 0–2/week
- **Surge:** Sustained 3–5/week

### Small Forces
- **Normal:** Often 0/week
- **Notable:** 2+ in a week
