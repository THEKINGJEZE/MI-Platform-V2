# Budget Cycles and Timing Windows

## Financial Year Structure

UK police financial year: **1 April to 31 March**

Police funding is aligned to this financial year. All budget cycles, settlement announcements, and "use it or lose it" behaviors operate on this calendar.

## Home Office Settlement Cycle

The Home Office settlement is the key driver of when forces can confidently go to market.

| Period | Event | Impact on Procurement |
|--------|-------|----------------------|
| **October-November** | Forces begin internal planning. Department heads submit "pressure bids" for additional resources | Early market engagement signals; pipeline-style notices |
| **December** | Home Office issues **Provisional Police Grant Report** | Forces learn central funding envelope; shapes what they can afford |
| **January** | Final settlement published. PCCs propose the "Precept" (Council Tax portion for police) | Budget unlocked; priorities can be confirmed |
| **February** | Final budgets approved by Police and Crime Panels | Procurement priorities finalized |
| **March** | Year-end push | Contract extensions, urgent competitions |
| **April** | New funds become active | Major strategic tenders (multi-year) typically released in Q1 |

## Q4 Sprint: "Use It or Lose It"

**Peak Activity Window: January 15 — March 31**

### Why This Happens

- Police budgets allocated annually with limited carryover for operational budgets
- Home Office grants (Safer Streets, County Lines Intensification) often have strict March 31 expenditure deadlines
- Underspends are politically painful
- Internal financial controls push spend/commitment by year-end

### Procurement Behaviors in Q4

1. **Direct Awards:** Forces use "exigency" or framework call-off mechanisms to bypass lengthy tenders

2. **Short-Term Augmentation:** Hiring managed teams for 3-6 month "blitz" operations (e.g., clearing case backlogs) to improve performance stats before year-end reporting

3. **Extensions/Modifications:** High frequency of contract extensions issued in this period

### System Heuristic

Boost lead score of:
- Opportunities published in January-March
- Extensions/modifications issued in this period
- Notices mentioning specific grant funding with FY deadlines

## Selling Windows by Quarter

| Quarter | Activity | Monitoring Focus |
|---------|----------|------------------|
| **Q1 (Apr-Jun)** | New budgets active. Major strategic tenders released | UK1 pipeline notices; new framework announcements |
| **Q2 (Jul-Sep)** | Steady state procurement. Framework call-offs | Tender notices; mini-competitions |
| **Q3 (Oct-Dec)** | Next-year planning. Market engagement begins | UK2 PME notices; UK3 planned procurement; supplier engagement days |
| **Q4 (Jan-Mar)** | Budget close. Urgent procurement. Extensions | Direct awards; short-term contracts; modifications |

## Election Cycles

PCC elections occur on a fixed 4-year cycle.

| Election | Date |
|----------|------|
| Last | May 2024 |
| Next | **May 2028** |

### Purdah (Pre-Election Period)

6-8 weeks prior to election:
- Major procurement decisions stall
- No new long-term contracts signed that might bind future PCC
- Low opportunity activity

### Post-Election Spike

Immediately following election:
- New PCCs issue "Police and Crime Plans" (e.g., "Zero Tolerance on Burglary")
- Wave of procurement for services aligning with new political priorities
- High opportunity activity

## HMICFRS Inspection Cycle

His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) publishes inspection reports on every force.

### How This Creates Procurement

If a report states:
- "The force has a significant backlog in digital forensics"
- "Investigations are delayed"
- Requires Improvement / Inadequate ratings

This is a *guaranteed* precursor to procurement. The force will be under pressure to fix the metric quickly, often via managed services.

### Monitoring Strategy

Track HMICFRS publications. Flag forces receiving negative findings in investigation-related areas as high-priority prospects within 3-12 months.

---

## Other Signal Sources

### Recruitment Freezes

News reports of "hiring freezes" for police officers often lead to pivot toward civilian investigator contractors to plug gaps without increasing permanent headcount.

### Capital Programmes

PCC decision logs approving:
- "Digital Transformation" funding
- "Operation Uplift" funding
- Major infrastructure investment

These indicate money is available and needs to be spent.

### Workforce Shortfalls

Forces publicly reporting:
- Detective shortages
- High attrition rates
- Training backlogs

Often trigger outsourcing to meet operational demand.
